    "## Problem 3 - Allocating locations (*8 points*)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview \n",
    "Following map shows the locations of the weather stations (as blue points) in Finland that are more than 70 years old [1].\n",
    "In this problem we are interested to find out whether the station network was equally distributed across Finland\n",
    "seventy years ago. We have divided Finland into four geographical zones (i.e. North West, North East, South West, South East)\n",
    "according the approximate center point of Finnish mainland located at `26.3, 64.5` (lon-lat in decimal degrees).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/FMI_stations_70_years_older.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "[1]: The locations and the age of weather stations were obtained from: http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/observation-stations\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we have given you the coordinates of 34 weather stations.\n",
    "The location of a single station is determined with a pair of latitude and longitude coordinates.\n",
    "The coordinates of all the stations are separated into two lists (`lat` and `lon`) and the names of the stations are in `stations` list. From these lists, you would get e.g. the location of the first station by combining the latitude and longitude coordinates from coordinate lists, and the name of that station from `stations` list at index[0]:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem your job is to print the names of weather stations located in different zones. You should also report the share of weather stations that allocated to each zone that could be used to evaluate if certain zone was over/under-represented seventy years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, you should modify and fill in the missing parts in the code cells below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notice**: follow closely the instructions, e.g. using **exactly** the same variable names as mentioned in the instructions because your answers will be automatically graded, and the tests that grade your answers rely on following the same formatting as in the instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your score on this problem will be based on following criteria:**\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Create four lists for geographical zones in Finland (i.e. `nort_west`, `north_east`, `south_west`, `south_east`)\n",
    " 2. Iterate over values and determine to which geographical zone the station belongs\n",
    "    1. Hint: You should create a loop that iterates `N` -number of times. Create a variable *`N`* that should contain the number of stations we have here.\n",
    "    2. You should use a conditional statement to find out if the latitude coordinate of a station is either North or South of the center point of Finland (`26.3, 64.5`) **AND** if the longitude location is West or East from that center point.\n",
    "    3. You should insert the name of the station into the correct geographical zone list (step 1)\n",
    " 3. Print out the names of stations at each geographical zone\n",
    " 4. Calculate and print the share of stations at each zone (the total number of stations equals to 100 %)"
