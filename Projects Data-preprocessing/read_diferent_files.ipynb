      "YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The\r\n",
      "Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter.  That book was made\r\n",
      "by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was things\r\n",
      "which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  I\r\n",
      "never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt\r\n",
      "Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she\r\n",
      "is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which\r\n",
      "is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the money\r\n",
      "that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got six\r\n",
      "thousand dollars apiece--all gold.  It was an awful sight of money when\r\n",
      "it was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out\r\n",
      "at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\r\n",
      "round--more than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas\r\n",
      "she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\r\n",
      "rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\r\n",
      "and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand\r\n",
      "it no longer I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\r\n",
      "again, and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\r\n",
      "said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\r\n",
      "would go back to the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\r\n",
      "called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by\r\n",
      "it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but\r\n",
      "sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thing\r\n",
      "commenced again.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come\r\n",
      "to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but\r\n",
      "you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little\r\n",
      "over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with\r\n",
      "them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In a\r\n",
      "barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the\r\n",
      "juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\r\n",
      "Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\r\n",
      "by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so\r\n",
      "then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in\r\n",
      "dead people.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.  But she\r\n",
      "wouldn't.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must\r\n",
      "try to not do it any more.  That is just the way with some people.  They\r\n",
      "get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it.  Here she was\r\n",
      "a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,\r\n",
      "being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a\r\n",
      "thing that had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course that\r\n",
      "was all right, because she done it herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\r\n",
      "had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\r\n",
      "spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\r\n",
      "the widow made her ease up.  I couldn't stood it much longer.  Then for\r\n",
      "an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.  Miss Watson would say,\r\n",
      "“Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don't scrunch up\r\n",
      "like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;” and pretty soon she would\r\n",
      "say, “Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to\r\n",
      "behave?”  Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished\r\n",
      "I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm.  All I wanted\r\n",
      "was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular.\r\n",
      " She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for\r\n",
      "the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\r\n",
      " Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I\r\n",
      "made up my mind I wouldn't try for it.  But I never said so, because it\r\n",
      "would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\r\n",
      "place.  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all\r\n",
      "day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.  So I didn't think\r\n",
      "much of it. But I never said so.  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\r\n",
      "would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.  I was glad\r\n",
      "about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\r\n",
      " By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\r\n",
      "everybody was off to bed.  I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\r\n",
      "and put it on the table.  Then I set down in a chair by the window and\r\n",
      "tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use.  I felt\r\n",
      "so lonesome I most wished I was dead.  The stars were shining, and the\r\n",
      "leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\r\n",
      "off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\r\n",
      "dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying\r\n",
      "to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so\r\n",
      "it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard\r\n",
      "that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about\r\n",
      "something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so\r\n",
      "can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night\r\n",
      "grieving.  I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some\r\n",
      "company.  Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I\r\n",
      "flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it\r\n",
      "was all shriveled up.  I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was\r\n",
      "an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared\r\n",
      "and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my\r\n",
      "tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied\r\n",
      "up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.  But\r\n",
      "I hadn't no confidence.  You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that\r\n",
      "you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever\r\n",
      "heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed\r\n",
      "a spider.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;\r\n",
      "for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't\r\n",
      "know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town\r\n",
      "go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than\r\n",
      "ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the\r\n",
      "trees--something was a stirring.  I set still and listened.  Directly I\r\n",
      "could just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there.  That was good!\r\n",
      " Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!” as soft as I could, and then I put out the\r\n",
      "light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.  Then I slipped\r\n",
      "down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,\r\n",
      "there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "CHAPTER II.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of\r\n",
      "the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our\r\n",
      "heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made\r\n",
      "a noise.  We scrouched down and laid still.  Miss Watson's big nigger,\r\n",
      "named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty\r\n",
      "clear, because there was a light behind him.  He got up and stretched\r\n",
      "his neck out about a minute, listening.  Then he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who dah?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right\r\n",
      "between us; we could a touched him, nearly.  Well, likely it was\r\n",
      "minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close\r\n",
      "together.  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I\r\n",
      "dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\r\n",
      "right between my shoulders.  Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.\r\n",
      " Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since.  If you are with\r\n",
      "the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't\r\n",
      "sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why\r\n",
      "you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim\r\n",
      "says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Say, who is you?  Whar is you?  Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n.\r\n",
      "Well, I know what I's gwyne to do:  I's gwyne to set down here and\r\n",
      "listen tell I hears it agin.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.  He leaned his back up\r\n",
      "against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched\r\n",
      "one of mine.  My nose begun to itch.  It itched till the tears come into\r\n",
      "my eyes.  But I dasn't scratch.  Then it begun to itch on the inside.\r\n",
      "Next I got to itching underneath.  I didn't know how I was going to set\r\n",
      "still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but\r\n",
      "it seemed a sight longer than that.  I was itching in eleven different\r\n",
      "places now.  I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer,\r\n",
      "but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.  Just then Jim begun\r\n",
      "to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon\r\n",
      "comfortable again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we\r\n",
      "went creeping away on our hands and knees.  When we was ten foot off Tom\r\n",
      "whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.  But I said\r\n",
      "no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I\r\n",
      "warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip\r\n",
      "in the kitchen and get some more.  I didn't want him to try.  I said Jim\r\n",
      "might wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there\r\n",
      "and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.\r\n",
      "Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do\r\n",
      "Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play\r\n",
      "something on him.  I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was\r\n",
      "so still and lonesome.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,\r\n",
      "and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of\r\n",
      "the house.  Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it\r\n",
      "on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.\r\n",
      "Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,\r\n",
      "and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,\r\n",
      "and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.  And next time Jim told\r\n",
      "it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every\r\n",
      "time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they\r\n",
      "rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back\r\n",
      "was all over saddle-boils.  Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he\r\n",
      "got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers.  Niggers would come\r\n",
      "miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any\r\n",
      "nigger in that country.  Strange niggers would stand with their mouths\r\n",
      "open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.  Niggers is\r\n",
      "always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but\r\n",
      "whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,\r\n",
      "Jim would happen in and say, “Hm!  What you know 'bout witches?” and\r\n",
      "that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  Jim always kept\r\n",
      "that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a\r\n",
      "charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could\r\n",
      "cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by\r\n",
      "saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.\r\n",
      " Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they\r\n",
      "had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch\r\n",
      "it, because the devil had had his hands on it.  Jim was most ruined for\r\n",
      "a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil\r\n",
      "and been rode by witches.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down\r\n",
      "into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where\r\n",
      "there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever\r\n",
      "so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and\r\n",
      "awful still and grand.  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and\r\n",
      "Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.\r\n",
      " So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,\r\n",
      "to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\r\n",
      "secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\r\n",
      "part of the bushes.  Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\r\n",
      "hands and knees.  We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\r\n",
      "opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked\r\n",
      "under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole.  We\r\n",
      "went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and\r\n",
      "sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  Tom says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.\r\n",
      "Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name\r\n",
      "in blood.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everybody was willing.  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had\r\n",
      "wrote the oath on, and read it.  It swore every boy to stick to the\r\n",
      "band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to\r\n",
      "any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and\r\n",
      "his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he\r\n",
      "had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign\r\n",
      "of the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that\r\n",
      "mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be\r\n",
      "killed.  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he\r\n",
      "must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the\r\n",
      "ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with\r\n",
      "blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it\r\n",
      "and be forgot forever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got\r\n",
      "it out of his own head.  He said, some of it, but the rest was out of\r\n",
      "pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had\r\n",
      "it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told\r\n",
      "the secrets.  Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote\r\n",
      "it in. Then Ben Rogers says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout\r\n",
      "him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, hain't he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days.  He\r\n",
      "used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen\r\n",
      "in these parts for a year or more.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and\r\n",

      "and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any,\r\n",

      "rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way,\r\n",
      "and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and\r\n",
      "saying there was devils a-hold of him.  He wore out by and by, and laid\r\n",
      "still a while, moaning.  Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound.\r\n",

      "very low:\r\n",

      "off--they're cold; let go.  Oh, let a poor devil alone!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the\r\n",
      "old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying.  I could\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he\r\n",

      "clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,\r\n",
      "and then I couldn't come for him no more.  I begged, and told him I\r\n",
      "was only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared and\r\n",
      "cussed, and kept on chasing me up.  Once when I turned short and\r\n",
      "dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my\r\n",
      "shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick\r\n",
      "as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and\r\n",
      "dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a\r\n",
      "minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would\r\n",

      "gun.  I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I\r\n",
      "laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down\r\n",

      "a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just\r\n",

      "sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the\r\n",
      "bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two\r\n",
      "blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.  I took fish-lines and\r\n",
      "matches and other things--everything that was worth a cent.  I cleaned\r\n",
      "out the place.  I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one out\r\n",
      "at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.  I fetched\r\n",
      "out the gun, and now I was done.\r\n",

      "it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely\r\n",
      "anybody would go fooling around there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track.  I\r\n",
      "followed around to see.  I stood on the bank and looked out over the\r\n",
      "river.  All safe.  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,\r\n",
      "and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon\r\n",
      "went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie\r\n",
      "farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I took the axe and smashed in the door.  I beat it and hacked it\r\n",
      "considerable a-doing it.  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly\r\n",
      "to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down\r\n",
      "on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground--hard packed,\r\n",
      "and no boards.  Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks\r\n",
      "in it--all I could drag--and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to\r\n",
      "the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and\r\n",
      "down it sunk, out of sight.  You could easy see that something had been\r\n",
      "dragged over the ground.  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he\r\n",
      "would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy\r\n",
      "touches.  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as\r\n",
      "that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and\r\n",
      "stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  Then I\r\n",
      "took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't\r\n",
      "drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into\r\n",
      "the river.  Now I thought of something else.  So I went and got the bag\r\n",
      "of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.\r\n",
      " I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the\r\n",
      "bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the\r\n",
      "place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  Then\r\n",
      "I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through\r\n",
      "the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide\r\n",
      "and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season.  There\r\n",
      "was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went\r\n",
      "miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river.  The meal\r\n",
      "sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.  I dropped\r\n",
      "pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by\r\n",
      "accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it\r\n",
      "wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some\r\n",
      "willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.  I\r\n",
      "made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid\r\n",
      "down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.  I says to myself,\r\n",
      "they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then\r\n",
      "drag the river for me.  And they'll follow that meal track to the lake\r\n",
      "and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers\r\n",
      "that killed me and took the things.  They won't ever hunt the river for\r\n",
      "anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't\r\n",
      "bother no more about me.  All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.\r\n",
      "Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,\r\n",
      "and nobody ever comes there.  And then I can paddle over to town nights,\r\n",
      "and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the\r\n",
      "place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.  When\r\n",
      "I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute.  I set up and looked\r\n",
      "around, a little scared.  Then I remembered.  The river looked miles and\r\n",
      "miles across.  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs\r\n",
      "that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from\r\n",
      "shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.\r\n",
      "You know what I mean--I don't know the words to put it in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start\r\n",
      "when I heard a sound away over the water.  I listened.  Pretty soon I\r\n",
      "made it out.  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from\r\n",
      "oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night.  I peeped out through\r\n",
      "the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.\r\n",
      " I couldn't tell how many was in it.  It kept a-coming, and when it was\r\n",
      "abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it.  Think's I, maybe\r\n",
      "it's pap, though I warn't expecting him.  He dropped below me with the\r\n",
      "current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,\r\n",
      "and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.\r\n",
      " Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his\r\n",
      "oars.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't lose no time.  The next minute I was a-spinning down stream\r\n",
      "soft but quick in the shade of the bank.  I made two mile and a half,\r\n",
      "and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of\r\n",
      "the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and\r\n",
      "people might see me and hail me.  I got out amongst the driftwood, and\r\n",
      "then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      " I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking\r\n",
      "away into the sky; not a cloud in it.  The sky looks ever so deep when\r\n",
      "you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.\r\n",
      " And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!  I heard people\r\n",
      "talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too--every word\r\n",
      "of it.  One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short\r\n",
      "nights now.  T'other one said _this_ warn't one of the short ones, he\r\n",
      "reckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they\r\n",
      "laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and\r\n",
      "laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said\r\n",
      "let him alone.  The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his\r\n",
      "old woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't\r\n",
      "nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it\r\n",
      "was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than\r\n",
      "about a week longer.  After that the talk got further and further away,\r\n",
      "and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,\r\n",
      "and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was away below the ferry now.  I rose up, and there was Jackson's\r\n",
      "Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and\r\n",
      "standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like\r\n",
      "a steamboat without any lights.  There warn't any signs of the bar at\r\n",
      "the head--it was all under water now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It didn't take me long to get there.  I shot past the head at a ripping\r\n",
      "rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and\r\n",
      "landed on the side towards the Illinois shore.  I run the canoe into\r\n",
      "a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow\r\n",
      "branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe\r\n",
      "from the outside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked\r\n",
      "out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,\r\n",
      "three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.  A\r\n",
      "monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,\r\n",
      "with a lantern in the middle of it.  I watched it come creeping down,\r\n",
      "and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, “Stern\r\n",
      "oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!”  I heard that just as plain\r\n",
      "as if the man was by my side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and\r\n",
      "laid down for a nap before breakfast.\r\n",

      "CHAPTER VIII.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight\r\n",
      "o'clock.  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about\r\n",
      "things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.  I\r\n",
      "could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees\r\n",
      "all about, and gloomy in there amongst them.  There was freckled places\r\n",
      "on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the\r\n",
      "freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little\r\n",
      "breeze up there.  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me\r\n",
      "very friendly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn't want to get up and cook\r\n",
      "breakfast.  Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep\r\n",
      "sound of “boom!” away up the river.  I rouses up, and rests on my elbow\r\n",
      "and listens; pretty soon I hears it again.  I hopped up, and went and\r\n",
      "looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying\r\n",
      "on the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry.  And there was the\r\n",
      "ferryboat full of people floating along down.  I knowed what was the\r\n",
      "matter now.  “Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's\r\n",
      "side.  You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my\r\n",
      "carcass come to the top.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,\r\n",
      "because they might see the smoke.  So I set there and watched the\r\n",
      "cannon-smoke and listened to the boom.  The river was a mile wide there,\r\n",
      "and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having a good\r\n",
      "enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to\r\n",
      "eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in\r\n",
      "loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the\r\n",
      "drownded carcass and stop there.  So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and\r\n",
      "if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show.  I\r\n",
      "changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could\r\n",
      "have, and I warn't disappointed.  A big double loaf come along, and I\r\n",
      "most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out\r\n",
      "further.  Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the\r\n",
      "shore--I knowed enough for that.  But by and by along comes another one,\r\n",
      "and this time I won.  I took out the plug and shook out the little dab\r\n",
      "of quicksilver, and set my teeth in.  It was “baker's bread”--what the\r\n",
      "quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching\r\n",
      "the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.  And\r\n",
      "then something struck me.  I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson\r\n",
      "or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone\r\n",
      "and done it.  So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that\r\n",
      "thing--that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the\r\n",
      "parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for\r\n",
      "only just the right kind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.  The\r\n",
      "ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance\r\n",
      "to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in\r\n",
      "close, where the bread did.  When she'd got pretty well along down\r\n",
      "towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,\r\n",
      "and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  Where\r\n",
      "the log forked I could peep through.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could\r\n",
      "a run out a plank and walked ashore.  Most everybody was on the boat.\r\n",
      " Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom\r\n",
      "Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.\r\n",
      " Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and\r\n",
      "says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's\r\n",
      "washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge.  I\r\n",
      "hope so, anyway.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't hope so.  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly\r\n",
      "in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  I could see\r\n",
      "them first-rate, but they couldn't see me.  Then the captain sung out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stand away!” and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that\r\n",
      "it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and\r\n",
      "I judged I was gone.  If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd\r\n",
      "a got the corpse they was after.  Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to\r\n",
      "goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder\r\n",
      "of the island.  I could hear the booming now and then, further and\r\n",
      "further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.\r\n",
      " The island was three mile long.  I judged they had got to the foot, and\r\n",
      "was giving it up.  But they didn't yet a while.  They turned around\r\n",
      "the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,\r\n",
      "under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.  I crossed over\r\n",
      "to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the\r\n",
      "island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and\r\n",
      "went home to the town.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I knowed I was all right now.  Nobody else would come a-hunting after\r\n",
      "me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick\r\n",
      "woods.  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things\r\n",
      "under so the rain couldn't get at them.  I catched a catfish and haggled\r\n",
      "him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had\r\n",
      "supper.  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well\r\n",
      "satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set\r\n",
      "on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the\r\n",
      "stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;\r\n",
      "there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you\r\n",
      "can't stay so, you soon get over it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And so for three days and nights.  No difference--just the same thing.\r\n",
      "But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.  I was\r\n",
      "boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know\r\n",
      "all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.  I found plenty\r\n",
      "strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green\r\n",
      "razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.  They\r\n",
      "would all come handy by and by, I judged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't\r\n",
      "far from the foot of the island.  I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot\r\n",
      "nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh\r\n",
      "home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,\r\n",
      "and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after\r\n",
      "it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I\r\n",
      "bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My heart jumped up amongst my lungs.  I never waited for to look\r\n",
      "further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as\r\n",
      "fast as ever I could.  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the\r\n",
      "thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear\r\n",
      "nothing else.  I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;\r\n",
      "and so on, and so on.  If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod\r\n",
      "on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my\r\n",
      "breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand\r\n",
      "in my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around.  So I\r\n",
      "got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,\r\n",
      "and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an\r\n",
      "old last year's camp, and then clumb a tree.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing,\r\n",
      "I didn't hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a\r\n",
      "thousand things.  Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I\r\n",
      "got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the\r\n",
      "time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from\r\n",
      "breakfast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By the time it was night I was pretty hungry.  So when it was good\r\n",
      "and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the\r\n",
      "Illinois bank--about a quarter of a mile.  I went out in the woods and\r\n",
      "cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there\r\n",
      "all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says\r\n",
      "to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices.  I got\r\n",
      "everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping\r\n",
      "through the woods to see what I could find out.  I hadn't got far when I\r\n",
      "hear a man say:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about\r\n",
      "beat out.  Let's look around.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.  I tied up in the\r\n",
      "old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't sleep much.  I couldn't, somehow, for thinking.  And every time\r\n",
      "I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.  So the sleep didn't\r\n",
      "do me no good.  By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm\r\n",
      "a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll\r\n",
      "find it out or bust.  Well, I felt better right off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and\r\n",
      "then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.  The moon was\r\n",
      "shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.\r\n",

      "me to chop off the snake's head and throw it away, and then skin the\r\n",
      "body and roast a piece of it.  I done it, and he eat it and said it\r\n",
      "would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around\r\n",
      "his wrist, too.  He said that that would help.  Then I slid out quiet\r\n",

      "that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't\r\n",
      "got to the end of it yet.  He said he druther see the new moon over his\r\n",
      "left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin\r\n",
      "in his hand.  Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I've\r\n",

      "one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.  Old Hank\r\n",

      "got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so\r\n",
      "that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him\r\n",
      "edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so\r\n",

      "again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big\r\n",
      "hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was\r\n",
      "as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two\r\n",
      "hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us\r\n",
      "into Illinois.  We just set there and watched him rip and tear around\r\n",
      "till he drownded.  We found a brass button in his stomach and a round\r\n",
      "ball, and lots of rubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet,\r\n",
      "and there was a spool in it.  Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to\r\n",
      "coat it over so and make a ball of it.  It was as big a fish as was ever\r\n",
      "catched in the Mississippi, I reckon.  Jim said he hadn't ever seen\r\n",
      "a bigger one.  He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.\r\n",
      " They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house\r\n",

      "Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a\r\n",
      "stirring up some way.  I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and\r\n",
      "find out what was going on.  Jim liked that notion; but he said I\r\n",
      "must go in the dark and look sharp.  Then he studied it over and said,\r\n",
      "couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?\r\n",
      " That was a good notion, too.  So we shortened up one of the calico\r\n",
      "gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.  Jim\r\n",
      "hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.  I put on the\r\n",
      "sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in\r\n",
      "and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.  Jim said\r\n",
      "nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.  I practiced around\r\n",
      "all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty\r\n",
      "well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said\r\n",

      "stranger, for you couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't know.\r\n",
      " Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had\r\n",

      "mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it\r\n",
      "no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my\r\n",
      "chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and\r\n",
      "I had been three nights coming the thirty miles.  I traveled nights,\r\n",
      "and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from\r\n",
      "home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.  I said I believed my\r\n",

      "jumped in, and was off in a hurry.  I went up-stream far enough to\r\n",
      "make the head of the island, and then started across.  I took off the\r\n",

      "a good fire there on a high and dry spot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half\r\n",

      "that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was\r\n",
      "ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid.  We\r\n",

      "but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows\r\n",
      "ain't good to see by.  Then we got out the raft and slipped along down\r\n",

      "IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at\r\n",
      "last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow.  If a boat was to come\r\n",
      "along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois\r\n",
      "shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to\r\n",
      "put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.  We\r\n",
      "was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things.  It warn't\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I\r\n",

      "away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a\r\n",
      "big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with\r\n",
      "the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there\r\n",
      "had been a cave-in in the bank there.  A tow-head is a sandbar that has\r\n",
      "cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois\r\n",
      "side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we\r\n",
      "warn't afraid of anybody running across us.  We laid there all day,\r\n",
      "and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and\r\n",
      "up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.  I told Jim all\r\n",
      "about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was\r\n",
      "a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set\r\n",
      "down and watch a camp fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog.  Well, then, I\r\n",
      "said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  Jim said he\r\n",
      "bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he\r\n",
      "believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that\r\n",
      "time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile\r\n",
      "below the village--no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.\r\n",
      " So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long\r\n",
      "as they didn't.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\r\n",
      "cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;\r\n",
      "so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug\r\n",
      "wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things\r\n",
      "dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above\r\n",
      "the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of\r\n",
      "reach of steamboat waves.  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a\r\n",
      "layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for\r\n",
      "to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather\r\n",
      "or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.  We made an extra\r\n",
      "steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag\r\n",
      "or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern\r\n",
      "on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat\r\n",
      "coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have\r\n",
      "to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call\r\n",
      "a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being\r\n",
      "still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the\r\n",
      "channel, but hunted easy water.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\r\n",
      "that was making over four mile an hour.  We catched fish and talked,\r\n",
      "and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness.  It was kind of\r\n",
      "solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking\r\n",
      "up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it\r\n",
      "warn't often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low chuckle.  We\r\n",
      "had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to\r\n",
      "us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,\r\n",
      "nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.  The\r\n",
      "fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.\r\n",
      "In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand\r\n",
      "people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful\r\n",
      "spread of lights at two o'clock that still night.  There warn't a sound\r\n",
      "there; everybody was asleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little\r\n",
      "village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other\r\n",
      "stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting\r\n",
      "comfortable, and took him along.  Pap always said, take a chicken when\r\n",
      "you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy\r\n",
      "find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot.  I never see\r\n",
      "pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to\r\n",
      "say, anyway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a\r\n",
      "watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of\r\n",
      "that kind.  Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you\r\n",
      "was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't\r\n",
      "anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.\r\n",
      " Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly\r\n",
      "right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things\r\n",
      "from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he reckoned\r\n",
      "it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others.  So we talked it over all\r\n",
      "one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds\r\n",
      "whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,\r\n",
      "or what.  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and\r\n",
      "concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons.  We warn't feeling just\r\n",
      "right before that, but it was all comfortable now.  I was glad the way\r\n",
      "it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons\r\n",
      "wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning\r\n",
      "or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening.  Take it all round, we\r\n",
      "lived pretty high.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with\r\n",
      "a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid\r\n",
      "sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.\r\n",
      "When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,\r\n",
      "and high, rocky bluffs on both sides.  By and by says I, “Hel-_lo_, Jim,\r\n",
      "looky yonder!” It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.\r\n",
      " We was drifting straight down for her.  The lightning showed her very\r\n",
      "distinct.  She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above\r\n",
      "water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a\r\n",
      "chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,\r\n",
      "when the flashes come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,\r\n",
      "I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck\r\n",
      "laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.  I\r\n",
      "wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what\r\n",
      "there was there.  So I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Le's land on her, Jim.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Jim was dead against it at first.  He says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack.  We's doin' blame' well,\r\n",
      "en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says.  Like as not\r\n",
      "dey's a watchman on dat wrack.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Watchman your grandmother,” I says; “there ain't nothing to watch but\r\n",
      "the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk\r\n",
      "his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when\r\n",
      "it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?”  Jim\r\n",
      "couldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try.  “And besides,” I says,\r\n",
      "“we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom.\r\n",

      "care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  Stick a\r\n",
      "candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.\r\n",
      " Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing?  Not for pie, he\r\n",
      "wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure--that's what he'd call it; and he'd\r\n",
      "land on that wreck if it was his last act.  And wouldn't he throw style\r\n",
      "into it?--wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing?  Why, you'd think it\r\n",
      "was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.  I wish Tom Sawyer\r\n",
      "_was_ here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jim he grumbled a little, but give in.  He said we mustn't talk any more\r\n",
      "than we could help, and then talk mighty low.  The lightning showed us\r\n",
      "the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and\r\n",
      "made fast there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The deck was high out here.  We went sneaking down the slope of it to\r\n",
      "labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our\r\n",
      "feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so\r\n",
      "dark we couldn't see no sign of them.  Pretty soon we struck the forward\r\n",
      "end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in\r\n",
      "front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down\r\n",
      "through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we\r\n",
      "seem to hear low voices in yonder!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come\r\n",
      "along.  I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just\r\n",
      "then I heard a voice wail out and say:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another voice said, pretty loud:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It's a lie, Jim Turner.  You've acted this way before.  You always want\r\n",
      "more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too, because\r\n",
      "you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell.  But this time you've said\r\n",

      "this country.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By this time Jim was gone for the raft.  I was just a-biling with\r\n",
      "curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now,\r\n",
      "and so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here.  So I\r\n",
      "dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft\r\n",
      "in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the\r\n",
      "cross-hall of the texas.  Then in there I see a man stretched on the\r\n",
      "floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one\r\n",
      "of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.\r\n",
      " This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and\r\n",
      "saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I'd _like_ to!  And I orter, too--a mean skunk!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, “Oh, please don't, Bill;\r\n",
      "I hain't ever goin' to tell.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“'Deed you _ain't!_  You never said no truer thing 'n that, you bet\r\n",
      "you.” And once he said:  “Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn't got the\r\n",
      "best of him and tied him he'd a killed us both.  And what _for_?  Jist\r\n",
      "for noth'n. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that's what for.  But\r\n",

      "_up_ that pistol, Bill.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“But I don't _want_ him killed, and I've got my reasons for it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard!  I'll never forgit you\r\n",
      "long's I live!” says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail\r\n",
      "and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill\r\n",
      "to come.  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat\r\n",
      "slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting\r\n",
      "run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.\r\n",
      " The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Here--come in here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And in he come, and Bill after him.  But before they got in I was up\r\n",
      "in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.  Then they stood there,\r\n",
      "with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked.  I couldn't see\r\n",
      "them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having.\r\n",
      " I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference\r\n",
      "anyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because I\r\n",
      "didn't breathe.  I was too scared.  And, besides, a body _couldn't_\r\n",
      "breathe and hear such talk.  They talked low and earnest.  Bill wanted\r\n",
      "to kill Turner.  He says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He's said he'll tell, and he will.  If we was to give both our shares\r\n",
      "to him _now_ it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way\r\n",
      "we've served him.  Shore's you're born, he'll turn State's evidence; now\r\n",
      "you hear _me_.  I'm for putting him out of his troubles.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So'm I,” says Packard, very quiet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't.  Well, then, that's all\r\n",
      "right.  Le's go and do it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit.  You listen to me.\r\n",
      "Shooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's _got_ to be\r\n",
      "done. But what I say is this:  it ain't good sense to go court'n around\r\n",
      "after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's\r\n",
      "jist as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks.  Ain't\r\n",
      "that so?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You bet it is.  But how you goin' to manage it this time?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, my idea is this:  we'll rustle around and gather up whatever\r\n",
      "pickins we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide\r\n",
      "the truck. Then we'll wait.  Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more'n two\r\n",
      "hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river.  See?\r\n",
      "He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own\r\n",
      "self.  I reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him.\r\n",
      " I'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it\r\n",
      "ain't good sense, it ain't good morals.  Ain't I right?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I reck'n you are.  But s'pose she _don't_ break up and wash off?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can't we?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right, then; come along.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled\r\n",
      "forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse\r\n",
      "whisper, “Jim!” and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a\r\n",
      "moan, and I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning; there's a\r\n",
      "gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don't hunt up their boat and set\r\n",
      "her drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from the\r\n",
      "wreck there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix.  But if we find their\r\n",
      "boat we can put _all_ of 'em in a bad fix--for the sheriff 'll get 'em.\r\n",
      "Quick--hurry!  I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You\r\n",
      "start at the raft, and--”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, my lordy, lordy!  _raf'_?  Dey ain' no raf' no mo'; she done broke\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted.  Shut up on a wreck with\r\n",
      "such a gang as that!  But it warn't no time to be sentimentering.  We'd\r\n",
      "_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves.  So we went\r\n",
      "a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,\r\n",
      "too--seemed a week before we got to the stern.  No sign of a boat.  Jim\r\n",
      "said he didn't believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn't\r\n",
      "hardly any strength left, he said.  But I said, come on, if we get left\r\n",
      "on this wreck we are in a fix, sure.  So on we prowled again.  We struck\r\n",
      "for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along\r\n",
      "forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the\r\n",
      "edge of the skylight was in the water.  When we got pretty close to the\r\n",
      "cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough!  I could just barely\r\n",
      "see her.  I felt ever so thankful.  In another second I would a been\r\n",
      "aboard of her, but just then the door opened.  One of the men stuck his\r\n",
      "head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;\r\n",
      "but he jerked it in again, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and\r\n",
      "set down.  It was Packard.  Then Bill _he_ come out and got in.  Packard\r\n",
      "says, in a low voice:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All ready--shove off!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak.  But Bill\r\n",
      "says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hold on--'d you go through him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No.  Didn't you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No.  So he's got his share o' the cash yet.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Say, won't he suspicion what we're up to?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Maybe he won't.  But we got to have it anyway. Come along.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they got out and went in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half\r\n",
      "second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me.  I out with my\r\n",
      "knife and cut the rope, and away we went!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor hardly even\r\n",
      "breathe.  We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the\r\n",
      "paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a\r\n",
      "hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every\r\n",
      "last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern\r\n",
      "show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed\r\n",
      "by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to\r\n",
      "understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.  Now was the\r\n",
      "first time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn't\r\n",
      "had time to before.  I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for\r\n",
      "murderers, to be in such a fix.  I says to myself, there ain't no\r\n",
      "telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would\r\n",
      "I like it?  So says I to Jim:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above\r\n",
      "it, in a place where it's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and\r\n",
      "then I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for\r\n",
      "that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when\r\n",
      "their time comes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,\r\n",
      "and this time worse than ever.  The rain poured down, and never a light\r\n",
      "showed; everybody in bed, I reckon.  We boomed along down the river,\r\n",
      "watching for lights and watching for our raft.  After a long time the\r\n",
      "rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,\r\n",
      "and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we\r\n",
      "made for it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again.  We\r\n",
      "seen a light now away down to the right, on shore.  So I said I would\r\n",
      "go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole\r\n",
      "there on the wreck.  We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told\r\n",
      "Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone\r\n",
      "about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars\r\n",
      "and shoved for the light.  As I got down towards it three or four more\r\n",
      "showed--up on a hillside.  It was a village.  I closed in above the shore\r\n",
      "light, and laid on my oars and floated.  As I went by I see it was a\r\n",
      "lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat.  I skimmed\r\n",
      "around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and\r\n",

      "amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while,\r\n",
      "anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o'-lantern.  You never\r\n",
      "knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.\r\n",

      "four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty\r\n",
      "men, likely.  She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open\r\n",
      "camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.  There was a\r\n",

      "talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to\r\n",

      "how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off\r\n",
      "a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks\r\n",
      "he's mighty smart.  Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to\r\n",
      "try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit.  She\r\n",
      "was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black\r\n",

      "always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a\r\n",
      "minute and a half.  Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was\r\n",
      "nearly busting.  I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of\r\n",
      "my nose, and puffed a bit.  Of course there was a booming current; and\r\n",
      "of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she\r\n",
      "stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was\r\n",

      "except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women.  They\r\n",
      "all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked.  The young women had\r\n",

      "on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann\r\n",
      "run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went\r\n",

      "trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died\r\n",
      "I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and\r\n",

      "went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all,\r\n",
      "I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to\r\n",

      "“Can you spell, Buck?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much\r\n",
      "style.  It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one\r\n",
      "with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in\r\n",
      "town. There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps\r\n",
      "of parlors in towns has beds in them.  There was a big fireplace that\r\n",
      "was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by\r\n",
      "pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes\r\n",
      "they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,\r\n",
      "same as they do in town.  They had big brass dog-irons that could hold\r\n",
      "up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with\r\n",
      "a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and\r\n",
      "a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the\r\n",
      "pendulum swinging behind it.  It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;\r\n",
      "and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her\r\n",
      "up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred\r\n",
      "and fifty before she got tuckered out.  They wouldn't took any money for\r\n",
      "her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,\r\n",
      "made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy.  By one of the\r\n",
      "parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;\r\n",
      "and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open\r\n",
      "their mouths nor look different nor interested.  They squeaked through\r\n",
      "underneath.  There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out\r\n",
      "behind those things.  On the table in the middle of the room was a kind\r\n",
      "of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and\r\n",
      "grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier\r\n",
      "than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where\r\n",
      "pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it\r\n",
      "was, underneath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and\r\n",
      "blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around.  It\r\n",
      "come all the way from Philadelphia, they said.  There was some books,\r\n",
      "too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.  One was a\r\n",
      "big family Bible full of pictures.  One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a\r\n",
      "man that left his family, it didn't say why.  I read considerable in it\r\n",
      "now and then.  The statements was interesting, but tough.  Another was\r\n",
      "Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't\r\n",
      "read the poetry.  Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr.\r\n",
      "Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body\r\n",
      "was sick or dead.  There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.  And\r\n",
      "there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged\r\n",
      "down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,\r\n",
      "and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing the\r\n",
      "Declaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one of the\r\n",
      "daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only\r\n",
      "fifteen years old.  They was different from any pictures I ever see\r\n",
      "before--blacker, mostly, than is common.  One was a woman in a slim black\r\n",
      "dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in\r\n",
      "the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with\r\n",
      "a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and\r\n",
      "very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a\r\n",
      "tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand\r\n",
      "hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,\r\n",
      "and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.”\r\n",
      "  Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight\r\n",
      "to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a\r\n",
      "chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird\r\n",
      "laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath\r\n",
      "the picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.”\r\n",
      "  There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the\r\n",
      "moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in\r\n",
      "one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was\r\n",
      "mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath\r\n",
      "the picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.”  These\r\n",
      "was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take\r\n",
      "to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the\r\n",
      "fan-tods.  Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot\r\n",
      "more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done\r\n",
      "what they had lost.  But I reckoned that with her disposition she was\r\n",
      "having a better time in the graveyard.  She was at work on what they\r\n",
      "said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and\r\n",
      "every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it\r\n",
      "done, but she never got the chance.  It was a picture of a young woman\r\n",
      "in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump\r\n",
      "off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with\r\n",
      "the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her\r\n",
      "breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up\r\n",
      "towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best,\r\n",
      "and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died\r\n",
      "before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the\r\n",
      "head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung\r\n",
      "flowers on it.  Other times it was hid with a little curtain.  The young\r\n",
      "woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so\r\n",
      "many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing “The Last Link is Broken”\r\n",
      " and play “The Battle of Prague” on it.  The walls of all the rooms was\r\n",
      "plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was\r\n",
      "whitewashed on the outside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed\r\n",
      "and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "COL.  Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.  He was a gentleman all\r\n",
      "over; and so was his family.  He was well born, as the saying is, and\r\n",
      "that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas\r\n",
      "said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy\r\n",
      "in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more\r\n",
      "quality than a mudcat himself.  Col.  Grangerford was very tall and\r\n",
      "very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it\r\n",
      "anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and\r\n",
      "he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and\r\n",
      "a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so\r\n",
      "deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at\r\n",
      "you, as you may say.  His forehead was high, and his hair was black and\r\n",
      "straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and\r\n",
      "every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head\r\n",
      "to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it;\r\n",
      "and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.  He\r\n",
      "carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.  There warn't no\r\n",
      "frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud.  He was\r\n",
      "as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had\r\n",
      "confidence.  Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he\r\n",
      "straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to\r\n",
      "flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,\r\n",
      "and find out what the matter was afterwards.  He didn't ever have to\r\n",
      "tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was always good-mannered\r\n",
      "where he was.  Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine\r\n",
      "most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather.  When he turned\r\n",
      "into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was\r\n",
      "enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got\r\n",
      "up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn't set down again\r\n",
      "till they had set down.  Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where\r\n",
      "the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and\r\n",
      "he held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and\r\n",
      "then they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam;” and _they_\r\n",
      "bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank,\r\n",
      "all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and\r\n",
      "the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and\r\n",
      "give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bob was the oldest and Tom next--tall, beautiful men with very broad\r\n",
      "shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes.  They\r\n",
      "dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and\r\n",
      "wore broad Panama hats.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud\r\n",
      "and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn't stirred up; but\r\n",
      "when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,\r\n",
      "like her father.  She was beautiful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind.  She was\r\n",
      "gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Each person had their own nigger to wait on them--Buck too.  My nigger\r\n",
      "had a monstrous easy time, because I warn't used to having anybody do\r\n",
      "anything for me, but Buck's was on the jump most of the time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be\r\n",
      "more--three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.\r\n",
      "Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or\r\n",
      "fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings\r\n",
      "round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods\r\n",
      "daytimes, and balls at the house nights.  These people was mostly\r\n",
      "kinfolks of the family.  The men brought their guns with them.  It was a\r\n",
      "handsome lot of quality, I tell you.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six\r\n",
      "families--mostly of the name of Shepherdson.  They was as high-toned\r\n",
      "and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.  The\r\n",
      "Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was\r\n",
      "about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a\r\n",
      "lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their\r\n",
      "fine horses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse\r\n",
      "coming.  We was crossing the road.  Buck says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quick!  Jump for the woods!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves.  Pretty\r\n",
      "soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his\r\n",
      "horse easy and looking like a soldier.  He had his gun across his\r\n",
      "pommel.  I had seen him before.  It was young Harney Shepherdson.  I\r\n",
      "heard Buck's gun go off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from his\r\n",
      "head.  He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was\r\n",
      "hid.  But we didn't wait.  We started through the woods on a run.  The\r\n",
      "woods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,\r\n",
      "and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away\r\n",
      "the way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't see.  We never\r\n",
      "stopped running till we got home.  The old gentleman's eyes blazed a\r\n",
      "minute--'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face sort of smoothed\r\n",
      "down, and he says, kind of gentle:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don't like that shooting from behind a bush.  Why didn't you step\r\n",
      "into the road, my boy?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The Shepherdsons don't, father.  They always take advantage.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling\r\n",
      "his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped.  The two young\r\n",
      "men looked dark, but never said nothing.  Miss Sophia she turned pale,\r\n",
      "but the color come back when she found the man warn't hurt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by\r\n",
      "ourselves, I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you want to kill him, Buck?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I bet I did.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What did he do to you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Him?  He never done nothing to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, nothing--only it's on account of the feud.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What's a feud?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, where was you raised?  Don't you know what a feud is?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never heard of it before--tell me about it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” says Buck, “a feud is this way:  A man has a quarrel with\r\n",
      "another man, and kills him; then that other man's brother kills _him_;\r\n",
      "then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the\r\n",
      "_cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody's killed off, and there ain't\r\n",
      "no more feud.  But it's kind of slow, and takes a long time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Has this one been going on long, Buck?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I should _reckon_!  It started thirty year ago, or som'ers along\r\n",
      "there.  There was trouble 'bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle\r\n",
      "it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the\r\n",
      "man that won the suit--which he would naturally do, of course.  Anybody\r\n",
      "would.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What was the trouble about, Buck?--land?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I reckon maybe--I don't know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, who done the shooting?  Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Laws, how do I know?  It was so long ago.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don't anybody know?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but they\r\n",
      "don't know now what the row was about in the first place.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Has there been many killed, Buck?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; right smart chance of funerals.  But they don't always kill.  Pa's\r\n",
      "got a few buckshot in him; but he don't mind it 'cuz he don't weigh\r\n",
      "much, anyway.  Bob's been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom's been\r\n",
      "hurt once or twice.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; we got one and they got one.  'Bout three months ago my cousin\r\n",
      "Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t'other side\r\n",
      "of the river, and didn't have no weapon with him, which was blame'\r\n",
      "foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind\r\n",
      "him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin' after him with his gun in\r\n",
      "his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and 'stead of jumping\r\n",
      "off and taking to the brush, Bud 'lowed he could out-run him; so they\r\n",
      "had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all\r\n",
      "the time; so at last Bud seen it warn't any use, so he stopped and faced\r\n",
      "around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old\r\n",
      "man he rode up and shot him down.  But he didn't git much chance to\r\n",
      "enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I reckon he _warn't_ a coward.  Not by a blame' sight.  There ain't a\r\n",
      "coward amongst them Shepherdsons--not a one.  And there ain't no cowards\r\n",
      "amongst the Grangerfords either.  Why, that old man kep' up his end in a\r\n",
      "fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come\r\n",
      "out winner.  They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got\r\n",
      "behind a little woodpile, and kep' his horse before him to stop the\r\n",
      "bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around\r\n",
      "the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them.\r\n",
      " Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the\r\n",
      "Grangerfords had to be _fetched_ home--and one of 'em was dead, and\r\n",
      "another died the next day.  No, sir; if a body's out hunting for cowards\r\n",
      "he don't want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz\r\n",
      "they don't breed any of that _kind_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody\r\n",
      "a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept\r\n",
      "them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall.  The\r\n",
      "Shepherdsons done the same.  It was pretty ornery preaching--all about\r\n",
      "brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was\r\n",
      "a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such\r\n",
      "a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and\r\n",
      "preforeordestination, and I don't know what all, that it did seem to me\r\n",
      "to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their\r\n",
      "chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull.  Buck and\r\n",
      "a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep.  I went up\r\n",
      "to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself.  I found that sweet\r\n",
      "Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took\r\n",
      "me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her,\r\n",
      "and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and\r\n",
      "not tell anybody, and I said I would.  Then she said she'd forgot her\r\n",
      "Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,\r\n",
      "and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say\r\n",
      "nothing to nobody.  I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the\r\n",
      "road, and there warn't anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,\r\n",
      "for there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor\r\n",
      "in summer-time because it's cool.  If you notice, most folks don't go to\r\n",
      "church only when they've got to; but a hog is different.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't natural for a girl to be in\r\n",
      "such a sweat about a Testament.  So I give it a shake, and out drops a\r\n",
      "little piece of paper with “HALF-PAST TWO” wrote on it with a pencil.  I\r\n",
      "ransacked it, but couldn't find anything else.  I couldn't make anything\r\n",
      "out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home\r\n",
      "and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.  She\r\n",
      "pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till\r\n",
      "she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and\r\n",
      "before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and\r\n",
      "said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody.  She was\r\n",
      "mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it\r\n",
      "made her powerful pretty.  I was a good deal astonished, but when I got\r\n",
      "my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I\r\n",
      "had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,\r\n",
      "and I told her “no, only coarse-hand,” and then she said the paper\r\n",
      "warn't anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and\r\n",
      "play now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon\r\n",
      "I noticed that my nigger was following along behind.  When we was out\r\n",
      "of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes\r\n",
      "a-running, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mars Jawge, if you'll come down into de swamp I'll show you a whole\r\n",
      "stack o' water-moccasins.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thinks I, that's mighty curious; he said that yesterday.  He oughter\r\n",
      "know a body don't love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for\r\n",
      "them. What is he up to, anyway?  So I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right; trot ahead.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded\r\n",
      "ankle deep as much as another half-mile.  We come to a little flat piece\r\n",
      "of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,\r\n",
      "and he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah's whah dey is.\r\n",
      "I's seed 'm befo'; I don't k'yer to see 'em no mo'.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid\r\n",
      "him.  I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch\r\n",
      "as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying\r\n",
      "there asleep--and, by jings, it was my old Jim!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to\r\n",
      "him to see me again, but it warn't.  He nearly cried he was so glad, but\r\n",
      "he warn't surprised.  Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard\r\n",
      "me yell every time, but dasn't answer, because he didn't want nobody to\r\n",
      "pick _him_ up and take him into slavery again.  Says he:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I got hurt a little, en couldn't swim fas', so I wuz a considable ways\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "TWO or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,\r\n",
      "they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.  Here is the way we put\r\n",
      "in the time.  It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a mile\r\n",
      "and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as\r\n",
      "night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always\r\n",
      "in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and\r\n",
      "willows, and hid the raft with them.  Then we set out the lines.  Next\r\n",
      "we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool\r\n",
      "off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee\r\n",
      "deep, and watched the daylight come.  Not a sound anywheres--perfectly\r\n",
      "still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs\r\n",
      "a-cluttering, maybe.  The first thing to see, looking away over the\r\n",
      "water, was a kind of dull line--that was the woods on t'other side; you\r\n",
      "couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more\r\n",
      "paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and\r\n",
      "warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots\r\n",
      "drifting along ever so far away--trading scows, and such things; and\r\n",
      "long black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or\r\n",
      "jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and\r\n",
      "by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the\r\n",
      "streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it\r\n",
      "and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off\r\n",
      "of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a\r\n",
      "log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of\r\n",
      "the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can\r\n",
      "throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and\r\n",
      "comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell\r\n",
      "on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,\r\n",
      "because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they\r\n",
      "do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything\r\n",
      "smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off\r\n",
      "of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.  And afterwards we would watch\r\n",
      "the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by\r\n",
      "lazy off to sleep.  Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and\r\n",
      "maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the\r\n",
      "other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was\r\n",
      "a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be\r\n",
      "nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid lonesomeness.  Next\r\n",
      "you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it\r\n",
      "chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the\r\n",
      "axe flash and come down--you don't hear nothing; you see that axe go\r\n",
      "up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the\r\n",
      "_k'chunk_!--it had took all that time to come over the water.  So we\r\n",
      "would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.  Once\r\n",
      "there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating\r\n",
      "tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them.  A scow or a\r\n",
      "raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and\r\n",
      "laughing--heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of them; it made\r\n",
      "you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.\r\n",
      " Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; spirits wouldn't say, 'Dern the dern fog.'”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the\r\n",
      "middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted\r\n",
      "her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and\r\n",
      "talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,\r\n",
      "whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck's folks made\r\n",
      "for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much on\r\n",
      "clothes, nohow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest\r\n",
      "time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe\r\n",
      "a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water\r\n",
      "you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe\r\n",
      "you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.\r\n",
      "It's lovely to live on a raft.  We had the sky up there, all speckled\r\n",
      "with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and\r\n",
      "discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.  Jim he\r\n",
      "allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would\r\n",
      "have took too long to _make_ so many.  Jim said the moon could a _laid_\r\n",
      "them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing\r\n",
      "against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it\r\n",
      "could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them\r\n",
      "streak down.  Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the\r\n",
      "nest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the\r\n",
      "dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out\r\n",
      "of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful\r\n",
      "pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and\r\n",
      "her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her\r\n",
      "waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the\r\n",
      "raft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't\r\n",
      "tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or\r\n",
      "three hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.\r\n",
      " These sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant\r\n",
      "morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to\r\n",
      "the main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a mile\r\n",
      "up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn't get some\r\n",
      "berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed\r\n",
      "the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as\r\n",
      "they could foot it.  I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was\r\n",
      "after anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim.  I was about to dig out\r\n",
      "from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung\r\n",
      "out and begged me to save their lives--said they hadn't been doing\r\n",
      "nothing, and was being chased for it--said there was men and dogs\r\n",
      "a-coming.  They wanted to jump right in, but I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don't you do it.  I don't hear the dogs and horses yet; you've got time\r\n",

      "off the scent.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,\r\n",
      "and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,\r\n",
      "shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn't\r\n",
      "see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got\r\n",
      "further and further away all the time, we couldn't hardly hear them at\r\n",
      "all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the\r\n",
      "river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid\r\n",
      "in the cottonwoods and was safe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and\r\n",

      "he'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a little\r\n",

      "pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn't\r\n",
      "nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.  That warn't\r\n",
      "enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.\r\n",
      " Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched\r\n",
      "this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it.\r\n",
      " Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of\r\n",
      "the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;\r\n",
      "Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four\r\n",
      "years old, so they never come up no more.  Well, for the next day or\r\n",
      "two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in\r\n",
      "skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we\r\n",
      "want to.  I'll think the thing over--I'll invent a plan that'll fix it.\r\n",

      "beginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see\r\n",
      "that.  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see\r\n",
      "what the beds was like.  My bed was a straw tick better than Jim's,\r\n",
      "which was a corn-shuck tick; there's always cobs around about in a shuck\r\n",
      "tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry\r\n",
      "shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it\r\n",
      "makes such a rustling that you wake up.  Well, the duke allowed he would\r\n",
      "take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't.  He says:\r\n",

      "“I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that\r\n",

      "We got away as soon as it was good and dark.  The king told us to stand\r\n",
      "well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we\r\n",
      "got a long ways below the town.  We come in sight of the little bunch of\r\n",
      "lights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half\r\n",
      "a mile out, all right.  When we was three-quarters of a mile below we\r\n",
      "hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain\r\n",
      "and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us\r\n",
      "to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke\r\n",
      "crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.  It was my watch\r\n",
      "below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd had a bed,\r\n",
      "because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week, not\r\n",
      "by a long sight.  My souls, how the wind did scream along!  And every\r\n",
      "second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half\r\n",
      "a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain,\r\n",
      "and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!--bum!\r\n",
      "bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and the thunder would go rumbling\r\n",
      "and grumbling away, and quit--and then RIP comes another flash and\r\n",
      "another sockdolager.  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,\r\n",
      "but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind.  We didn't have no trouble\r\n",
      "about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant\r\n",
      "that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or\r\n",
      "that and miss them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,\r\n",

      "and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for\r\n",
      "me; so I laid outside--I didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and\r\n",
      "the waves warn't running so high now.  About two they come up again,\r\n",
      "though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because\r\n",
      "he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was\r\n",
      "mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was\r\n",

      "slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into\r\n",
      "for legs. They didn't have no backs.  The preachers had high platforms\r\n",
      "to stand on at one end of the sheds.  The women had on sun-bonnets;\r\n",
      "and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the\r\n",
      "young ones had on calico.  Some of the young men was barefooted, and\r\n",
      "some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen\r\n",

      "there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then\r\n",

      "more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some\r\n",

      "preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of\r\n",
      "the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front\r\n",
      "of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his\r\n",
      "words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up\r\n",
      "his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and\r\n",
      "that, shouting, “It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness!  Look upon\r\n",
      "it and live!”  And people would shout out, “Glory!--A-a-_men_!”  And so\r\n",
      "he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:\r\n",

      "mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and\r\n",
      "shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him\r\n",
      "over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and\r\n",
      "the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it.  He\r\n",
      "told them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the\r\n",
      "Indian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in\r\n",
      "a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to\r\n",
      "goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat\r\n",
      "without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that\r\n",
      "ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for\r\n",
      "the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start\r\n",
      "right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest\r\n",
      "of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could\r\n",
      "do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews\r\n",
      "in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there\r\n",
      "without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced\r\n",
      "a pirate he would say to him, “Don't you thank me, don't you give me no\r\n",
      "credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting,\r\n",
      "natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher\r\n",
      "there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody.  Then somebody\r\n",
      "sings out, “Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!”  Well,\r\n",
      "a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, “Let _him_\r\n",
      "pass the hat around!”  Then everybody said it, the preacher too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,\r\n",
      "and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being\r\n",
      "so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the\r\n",
      "prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would\r\n",
      "up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he\r\n",
      "always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or\r\n",
      "six times--and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to\r\n",
      "live in their houses, and said they'd think it was an honor; but he said\r\n",
      "as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn't do no good, and\r\n",
      "besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to\r\n",
      "work on the pirates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had\r\n",
      "collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.  And then he had\r\n",
      "fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a\r\n",
      "wagon when he was starting home through the woods.  The king said,\r\n",
      "take it all around, it laid over any day he'd ever put in in the\r\n",
      "missionarying line.  He said it warn't no use talking, heathens don't\r\n",
      "amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pretty well till the king come\r\n",
      "to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much.  He had set\r\n",
      "up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that\r\n",
      "printing-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars.  And he\r\n",
      "had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he\r\n",
      "said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so\r\n",
      "they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took\r\n",
      "in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them\r\n",
      "paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as\r\n",
      "usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the\r\n",
      "price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.\r\n",
      " He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of\r\n",
      "his own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,\r\n",
      "“Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart”--and he left that all set\r\n",
      "up and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it.\r\n",
      " Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done a pretty\r\n",
      "square day's work for it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged\r\n",
      "for, because it was for us.  It had a picture of a runaway nigger with\r\n",
      "a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and “$200 reward” under it.  The\r\n",
      "reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot.  It said\r\n",
      "he run away from St. Jacques' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,\r\n",
      "last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send\r\n",
      "him back he could have the reward and expenses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now,” says the duke, “after to-night we can run in the daytime if we\r\n",
      "want to.  Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot\r\n",
      "with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we\r\n",
      "captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat,\r\n",
      "so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down\r\n",
      "to get the reward.  Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim,\r\n",
      "but it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor.  Too much\r\n",
      "like jewelry.  Ropes are the correct thing--we must preserve the unities,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke's work in\r\n",
      "the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could\r\n",
      "boom right along if we wanted to.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten\r\n",
      "o'clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn't\r\n",
      "hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.\r\n",

      "king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after\r\n",
      "they'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good\r\n",
      "deal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft,\r\n",
      "and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs\r\n",
      "dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went\r\n",
      "to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart.  When he had got it pretty\r\n",
      "good him and the duke begun to practice it together.  The duke had to\r\n",
      "learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him\r\n",
      "sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done\r\n",
      "it pretty well; “only,” he says, “you mustn't bellow out _Romeo_!\r\n",
      "that way, like a bull--you must say it soft and sick and languishy,\r\n",
      "so--R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet's a dear sweet mere child of\r\n",
      "a girl, you know, and she doesn't bray like a jackass.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out\r\n",
      "of oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight--the duke called\r\n",
      "himself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around\r\n",
      "the raft was grand to see.  But by and by the king tripped and fell\r\n",
      "overboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all\r\n",

      "squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next\r\n",
      "he would sigh, and next he'd let on to drop a tear.  It was beautiful\r\n",
      "to see him. By and by he got it.  He told us to give attention.  Then\r\n",
      "he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his\r\n",
      "arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;\r\n",

      "minutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right away.  But it didn't\r\n",
      "do no good.  He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down\r\n",
      "in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down\r\n",

      "could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use--up the street\r\n",
      "he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing.  By and by\r\n",

      "a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along.\r\n",
      "He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn't hanging back any, but was\r\n",
      "doing some of the hurrying himself.  Somebody sings out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Boggs!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel\r\n",
      "Sherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a\r\n",
      "pistol raised in his right hand--not aiming it, but holding it out with\r\n",
      "the barrel tilted up towards the sky.  The same second I see a young\r\n",
      "girl coming on the run, and two men with her.  Boggs and the men turned\r\n",
      "round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men\r\n",
      "jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to\r\n",
      "a level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says,\r\n",
      "“O Lord, don't shoot!”  Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back,\r\n",
      "clawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards\r\n",
      "on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out.  That young\r\n",
      "girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her\r\n",
      "father, crying, and saying, “Oh, he's killed him, he's killed him!”  The\r\n",
      "crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with\r\n",
      "their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned\r\n",
      "around on his heels and walked off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just\r\n",
      "the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good\r\n",
      "place at the window, where I was close to him and could see in.  They\r\n",
      "laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened\r\n",
      "another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt\r\n",
      "first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in.  He made about a\r\n",
      "dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his\r\n",
      "breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out--and after that\r\n",
      "he laid still; he was dead.  Then they pulled his daughter away from\r\n",
      "him, screaming and crying, and took her off.  She was about sixteen, and\r\n",
      "very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and\r\n",
      "pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people\r\n",
      "that had the places wouldn't give them up, and folks behind them was\r\n",
      "saying all the time, “Say, now, you've looked enough, you fellows;\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe\r\n",
      "there was going to be trouble.  The streets was full, and everybody was\r\n",
      "excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened,\r\n",
      "and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows,\r\n",
      "stretching their necks and listening.  One long, lanky man, with long\r\n",
      "hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a\r\n",
      "crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs\r\n",
      "stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from\r\n",
      "one place to t'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their\r\n",
      "heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their\r\n",
      "hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with\r\n",
      "his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had\r\n",
      "stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung\r\n",
      "out, “Boggs!” and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says\r\n",
      "“Bang!” staggered backwards, says “Bang!” again, and fell down flat on\r\n",
      "his back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect;\r\n",
      "said it was just exactly the way it all happened.  Then as much as a\r\n",
      "dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched.  In about a\r\n",

      "Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped\r\n",
      "to mush, and it was awful to see.  Children was heeling it ahead of the\r\n",
      "mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they could\r\n",

      "was a little twenty-foot yard.  Some sung out “Tear down the fence! tear\r\n",

      "with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the\r\n",
      "drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every\r\n",
      "jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing\r\n",
      "till tears rolled down.  And at last, sure enough, all the circus men\r\n",

      "to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,\r\n",
      "and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy.  It\r\n",
      "warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.\r\n",
      " But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,\r\n",
      "a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and\r\n",
      "dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire\r\n",
      "too.  He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable\r\n",
      "as if he warn't ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his\r\n",
      "clothes and sling them.  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up\r\n",
      "the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he\r\n",
      "was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you\r\n",
      "ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly\r\n",
      "hum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to\r\n",
      "the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and\r\n",
      "astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech,\r\n",
      "and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one\r\n",
      "that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about\r\n",
      "Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it;\r\n",
      "and at last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough, he\r\n",

      "out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over,\r\n",
      "ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a\r\n",
      "rainbow.  And--but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild,\r\n",
      "but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and\r\n",
      "when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they\r\n",
      "roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done\r\n",

      "would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says\r\n",
      "the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of\r\n",
      "pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it\r\n",
      "in Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has\r\n",
      "succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply\r\n",

      "out, “Sold!” and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage and them\r\n",

      "this whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long\r\n",
      "as we live.  _No_.  What we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk\r\n",
      "this show up, and sell the _rest_ of the town!  Then we'll all be in the\r\n",

      "warn't no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight.  I smelt sickly eggs\r\n",

      "signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four\r\n",

      "NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in\r\n",
      "the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the\r\n",
      "duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.  Jim\r\n",
      "he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few\r\n",
      "hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to\r\n",
      "lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.  You see, when we left him\r\n",
      "all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all\r\n",
      "by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway\r\n",
      "nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay\r\n",
      "roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.  He dressed\r\n",
      "Jim up in King Lear's outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a\r\n",
      "white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint\r\n",
      "and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,\r\n",
      "dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days.  Blamed if\r\n",
      "he warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.  Then the duke took\r\n",
      "and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five\r\n",
      "foot in front of the wigwam.  Jim was satisfied.  He said it was a sight\r\n",
      "better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all\r\n",
      "over every time there was a sound.  The duke told him to make himself\r\n",
      "free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop\r\n",
      "out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like\r\n",
      "a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.\r\n",
      " Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he\r\n",
      "wouldn't wait for him to howl.  Why, he didn't only look like he was\r\n",
      "dead, he looked considerable more than that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was\r\n",
      "so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe\r\n",
      "the news might a worked along down by this time.  They couldn't hit no\r\n",
      "project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd\r\n",
      "lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up\r\n",
      "something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop\r\n",
      "over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence\r\n",
      "to lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon.  We had all\r\n",
      "bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n\r\n",
      "on, and he told me to put mine on.  I done it, of course.  The king's\r\n",
      "duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.  I never\r\n",
      "knowed how clothes could change a body before.  Why, before, he looked\r\n",
      "like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off\r\n",
      "his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand\r\n",
      "and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark,\r\n",
      "and maybe was old Leviticus himself.  Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I\r\n",
      "got my paddle ready.  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away\r\n",
      "up under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple\r\n",
      "of hours, taking on freight.  Says the king:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.\r\n",
      "Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place.  Go for the steamboat,\r\n",
      "Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.\r\n",
      " I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went\r\n",
      "scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water.  Pretty soon we come to\r\n",
      "a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the\r\n",
      "sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a\r\n",
      "couple of big carpet-bags by him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Run her nose in shore,” says the king.  I done it.  “Wher' you bound\r\n",

      "I see.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I done so, and then we all three started on again.  The young chap was\r\n",
      "mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather.\r\n",
      "He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he'd come\r\n",
      "down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he\r\n",
      "was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there.  The\r\n",
      "young fellow says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and he\r\n",
      "come mighty near getting here in time.'  But then I says again, 'No, I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“No, my name's Blodgett--Elexander Blodgett--_Reverend_ Elexander\r\n",
      "Blodgett, I s'pose I must say, as I'm one o' the Lord's poor servants.\r\n",
      " But still I'm jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving\r\n",
      "in time, all the same, if he's missed anything by it--which I hope he\r\n",
      "hasn't.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get that all\r\n",

      "in this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothing\r\n",

      "George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married\r\n",

      "said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this\r\n",
      "time. You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too young to\r\n",
      "be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he\r\n",
      "was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn't seem\r\n",
      "to care much to live.  He most desperately wanted to see Harvey--and\r\n",
      "William, too, for that matter--because he was one of them kind that can't\r\n",
      "bear to make a will.  He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he'd\r\n",
      "told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the\r\n",
      "property divided up so George's g'yirls would be all right--for George\r\n",

      "got the letter at all, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Too bad, too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers, poor soul.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well, they could be worse off.  Old Peter had friends, and they\r\n",

      "preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,\r\n",

      "here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied\r\n",

      "carpenter; and about Harvey's--which was a dissentering minister; and so\r\n",

      "“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“When did you say he died?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Funeral to-morrow, likely?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, 'bout the middle of the day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she\r\n",
      "got off.  The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost\r\n",
      "my ride, after all.  When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up\r\n",
      "another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new\r\n",
      "carpet-bags.  And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there and\r\n",
      "git him.  And tell him to git himself up regardless.  Shove along, now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.  When\r\n",
      "I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a\r\n",
      "log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had\r\n",
      "said it--every last word of it.  And all the time he was a-doing it he\r\n",
      "tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for\r\n",
      "a slouch. I can't imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but he\r\n",
      "really done it pretty good.  Then he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef\r\n",
      "and dumb person on the histronic boards.  So then they waited for a\r\n",
      "steamboat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,\r\n",
      "but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there\r\n",
      "was a big one, and they hailed her.  She sent out her yawl, and we went\r\n",
      "aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted\r\n",
      "to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and\r\n",
      "said they wouldn't land us.  But the king was ca'm.  He says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and\r\n",
      "put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the\r\n",
      "village they yawled us ashore.  About two dozen men flocked down when\r\n",
      "they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?” they\r\n",
      "give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say,\r\n",
      "“What d' I tell you?”  Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I'm sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_\r\n",
      "live yesterday evening.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up\r\n",
      "against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his\r\n",
      "back, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Alas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him; oh,\r\n",
      "it's too, too hard!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to\r\n",
      "the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet-bag and\r\n",
      "bust out a-crying.  If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds,\r\n",
      "that ever I struck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all\r\n",
      "sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill\r\n",
      "for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about\r\n",
      "his brother's last moments, and the king he told it all over again on\r\n",
      "his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner\r\n",
      "like they'd lost the twelve disciples.  Well, if ever I struck anything\r\n",

      "again, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and\r\n",
      "before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,\r\n",
      "and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody\r\n",
      "saying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was\r\n",
      "all busy listening.  The king was saying--in the middle of something he'd\r\n",

      "his funeral orgies sh'd be public.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and\r\n",
      "every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke\r\n",
      "he couldn't stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,\r\n",
      "“_Obsequies_, you old fool,” and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and\r\n",
      "reaching it over people's heads to him.  The king he reads it and puts\r\n",
      "it in his pocket, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Poor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart's_ aluz right.  Asks me\r\n",

      "when he done it the third time he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "ain't--obsequies bein' the common term--but because orgies is the right\r\n",
      "term. Obsequies ain't used in England no more now--it's gone out.  We\r\n",
      "say orgies now in England.  Orgies is better, because it means the thing\r\n",
      "you're after more exact.  It's a word that's made up out'n the Greek\r\n",
      "_orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to plant, cover\r\n",

      "I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring.  So I tiptoed\r\n",
      "along, and got down stairs all right.  There warn't a sound anywheres.\r\n",
      " I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that\r\n",
      "was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs.  The door\r\n",
      "was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a\r\n",
      "candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but\r\n",
      "I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I\r\n",
      "shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there.\r\n",
      " Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me.  I\r\n",
      "run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I\r\n",
      "see to hide the bag was in the coffin.  The lid was shoved along about\r\n",
      "a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with a wet cloth over\r\n",
      "it, and his shroud on.  I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just\r\n",
      "down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was\r\n",
      "so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The person coming was Mary Jane.  She went to the coffin, very soft, and\r\n",
      "kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see\r\n",
      "she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me.  I\r\n",
      "slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure them\r\n",
      "watchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything\r\n",
      "was all right.  They hadn't stirred.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing\r\n",
      "playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much\r\n",
      "resk about it.  Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because\r\n",
      "when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to\r\n",
      "Mary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain't the\r\n",
      "thing that's going to happen; the thing that's going to happen is, the\r\n",
      "money 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid.  Then the king\r\n",
      "'ll get it again, and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody\r\n",
      "another chance to smouch it from him. Of course I _wanted_ to slide\r\n",
      "down and get it out of there, but I dasn't try it.  Every minute it was\r\n",
      "getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin\r\n",
      "to stir, and I might get catched--catched with six thousand dollars in my\r\n",
      "hands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of.  I don't wish to be\r\n",
      "mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the\r\n",
      "watchers was gone.  There warn't nobody around but the family and the\r\n",
      "widow Bartley and our tribe.  I watched their faces to see if anything\r\n",
      "had been happening, but I couldn't tell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they\r\n",
      "set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then\r\n",
      "set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till\r\n",
      "the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full.  I see the coffin\r\n",
      "lid was the way it was before, but I dasn't go to look in under it, with\r\n",
      "folks around.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took\r\n",
      "seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour\r\n",
      "the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the\r\n",
      "dead man's face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was\r\n",
      "all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding\r\n",
      "handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a\r\n",
      "little.  There warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on\r\n",
      "the floor and blowing noses--because people always blows them more at a\r\n",
      "funeral than they do at other places except church.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his\r\n",
      "black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last\r\n",
      "touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable,\r\n",
      "and making no more sound than a cat.  He never spoke; he moved people\r\n",
      "around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done\r\n",
      "it with nods, and signs with his hands.  Then he took his place over\r\n",
      "against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever\r\n",
      "see; and there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had borrowed a melodeum--a sick one; and when everything was ready\r\n",
      "a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and\r\n",
      "colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one\r\n",
      "that had a good thing, according to my notion.  Then the Reverend Hobson\r\n",
      "opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most\r\n",
      "outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only\r\n",
      "one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right\r\n",
      "along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait--you\r\n",
      "couldn't hear yourself think.  It was right down awkward, and nobody\r\n",
      "didn't seem to know what to do.  But pretty soon they see that\r\n",
      "long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,\r\n",
      "“Don't you worry--just depend on me.”  Then he stooped down and begun\r\n",
      "to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people's\r\n",
      "heads.  So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and\r\n",
      "more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two\r\n",
      "sides of the room, he disappears down cellar.  Then in about two seconds\r\n",
      "we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or\r\n",
      "two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn\r\n",
      "talk where he left off.  In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's\r\n",
      "back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and\r\n",
      "glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his\r\n",
      "mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher,\r\n",
      "over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “_He\r\n",
      "had a rat_!”  Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to\r\n",
      "his place.  You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people,\r\n",
      "because naturally they wanted to know.  A little thing like that don't\r\n",
      "cost nothing, and it's just the little things that makes a man to be\r\n",
      "looked up to and liked.  There warn't no more popular man in town than\r\n",
      "what that undertaker was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and\r\n",
      "then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and\r\n",
      "at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the\r\n",
      "coffin with his screw-driver.  I was in a sweat then, and watched him\r\n",
      "pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as\r\n",
      "soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast.  So there I was!  I\r\n",
      "didn't know whether the money was in there or not.  So, says I, s'pose\r\n",
      "somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?--now how do I know whether\r\n",
      "to write to Mary Jane or not? S'pose she dug him up and didn't find\r\n",
      "nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get\r\n",
      "hunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at\r\n",
      "all; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened it\r\n",
      "a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I'd just let it alone, dad fetch\r\n",
      "the whole business!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces\r\n",
      "again--I couldn't help it, and I couldn't rest easy.  But nothing come of\r\n",
      "it; the faces didn't tell me nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up,\r\n",
      "and made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his\r\n",
      "congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must\r\n",
      "hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home.  He was\r\n",
      "very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could\r\n",
      "stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn't be done.  And he\r\n",
      "said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and\r\n",
      "that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed\r\n",
      "and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too--tickled\r\n",
      "them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told\r\n",
      "him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready.  Them\r\n",
      "poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them\r\n",
      "getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn't see no safe way for me to\r\n",
      "chip in and change the general tune.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all\r\n",
      "the property for auction straight off--sale two days after the funeral;\r\n",
      "but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls' joy\r\n",
      "got the first jolt.  A couple of nigger traders come along, and the king\r\n",
      "sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called\r\n",
      "it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their\r\n",
      "mother down the river to Orleans.  I thought them poor girls and them\r\n",
      "niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each\r\n",
      "other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it.  The girls\r\n",
      "said they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold\r\n",
      "away from the town.  I can't ever get it out of my memory, the sight of\r\n",
      "them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks\r\n",
      "and crying; and I reckon I couldn't a stood it all, but would a had\r\n",
      "to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn't no\r\n",
      "account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out\r\n",
      "flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the\r\n",
      "children that way.  It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he\r\n",
      "bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell\r\n",
      "you the duke was powerful uneasy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next day was auction day.  About broad day in the morning the king and\r\n",
      "the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look\r\n",
      "that there was trouble.  The king says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was you in my room night before last?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, your majesty”--which was the way I always called him when nobody but\r\n",
      "our gang warn't around.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was you in there yisterday er last night?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, your majesty.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Honor bright, now--no lies.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Honor bright, your majesty, I'm telling you the truth.  I hain't been\r\n",
      "a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed\r\n",
      "it to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The duke says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you seen anybody else go in there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stop and think.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn't ever\r\n",
      "expected it, and then like they _had_.  Then the duke says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What, all of them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No--leastways, not all at once--that is, I don't think I ever see them\r\n",
      "all come _out_ at once but just one time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hello!  When was that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was the day we had the funeral.  In the morning.  It warn't early,\r\n",
      "because I overslept.  I was just starting down the ladder, and I see\r\n",
      "them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, go on, _go_ on!  What did they do?  How'd they act?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They didn't do nothing.  And they didn't act anyway much, as fur as I\r\n",
      "see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they'd shoved in\r\n",
      "there to do up your majesty's room, or something, s'posing you was up;\r\n",
      "and found you _warn't_ up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the\r\n",
      "way of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn't already waked you\r\n",
      "up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Great guns, _this_ is a go!” says the king; and both of them looked\r\n",
      "pretty sick and tolerable silly.  They stood there a-thinking and\r\n",
      "scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a\r\n",
      "little raspy chuckle, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand.  They let on\r\n",
      "to be _sorry_ they was going out of this region!  And I believed they\r\n",
      "_was_ sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody.  Don't ever tell _me_\r\n",
      "any more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent.  Why, the way\r\n",
      "they played that thing it would fool _anybody_.  In my opinion, there's\r\n",
      "a fortune in 'em.  If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn't want a\r\n",
      "better lay-out than that--and here we've gone and sold 'em for a song.\r\n",
      " Yes, and ain't privileged to sing the song yet.  Say, where _is_ that\r\n",
      "song--that draft?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In the bank for to be collected.  Where _would_ it be?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, _that's_ all right then, thank goodness.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Says I, kind of timid-like:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is something gone wrong?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The king whirls on me and rips out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“None o' your business!  You keep your head shet, and mind y'r own\r\n",
      "affairs--if you got any.  Long as you're in this town don't you forgit\r\n",
      "_that_--you hear?”  Then he says to the duke, “We got to jest swaller it\r\n",
      "and say noth'n':  mum's the word for _us_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and\r\n",
      "says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quick sales _and_ small profits!  It's a good business--yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The king snarls around on him and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick.  If the\r\n",
      "profits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable, and none to\r\n",
      "carry, is it my fault any more'n it's yourn?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, _they'd_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn't_ if I could a got\r\n",
      "my advice listened to.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped\r\n",
      "around and lit into _me_ again.  He give me down the banks for not\r\n",
      "coming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room acting\r\n",
      "that way--said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up.  And then\r\n",
      "waltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him not\r\n",
      "laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he'd be\r\n",
      "blamed if he'd ever do it again.  So they went off a-jawing; and I felt\r\n",
      "dreadful glad I'd worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn't\r\n",
      "done the niggers no harm by it.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "BY and by it was getting-up time.  So I come down the ladder and started\r\n",
      "for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls' room the door was open, and\r\n",
      "I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she'd\r\n",
      "been packing things in it--getting ready to go to England.  But she\r\n",
      "had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her\r\n",
      "hands, crying.  I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would.  I\r\n",
      "went in there and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see people in trouble, and I\r\n",
      "can't--most always.  Tell me about it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So she done it.  And it was the niggers--I just expected it.  She said\r\n",

      "know _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and\r\n",
      "the children warn't ever going to see each other no more--and then busted\r\n",
      "out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain't _ever_ going to see each other any\r\n",
      "more!”\r\n",

      "_again_, say it _again_!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close\r\n",
      "place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very\r\n",
      "impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and\r\n",
      "eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out.  So I went to\r\n",
      "studying it out.  I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells\r\n",
      "the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks,\r\n",
      "though I ain't had no experience, and can't say for certain; but it\r\n",
      "looks so to me, anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest if it\r\n",
      "don't look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie.\r\n",
      " I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it's\r\n",
      "so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it.  Well, I\r\n",
      "says to myself at last, I'm a-going to chance it; I'll up and tell the\r\n",
      "truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of\r\n",
      "powder and touching it off just to see where you'll go to. Then I says:\r\n",

      "“Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you\r\n",

      "THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a\r\n",
      "nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling.  And, my souls,\r\n",
      "how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up.  But I didn't see no\r\n",
      "joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some\r\n",
      "to see any.  I reckoned they'd turn pale.  But no, nary a pale did\r\n",
      "_they_ turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but\r\n",
      "just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that's\r\n",
      "googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed\r\n",
      "down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in\r\n",
      "his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the\r\n",
      "world.  Oh, he done it admirable.  Lots of the principal people\r\n",
      "gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side.  That old\r\n",
      "gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death.  Pretty\r\n",
      "soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an\r\n",
      "Englishman--not the king's way, though the king's _was_ pretty good for\r\n",
      "an imitation.  I can't give the old gent's words, nor I can't imitate\r\n",
      "him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll\r\n",
      "acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it and\r\n",
      "answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he's broke his\r\n",
      "arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the\r\n",
      "night by a mistake.  I am Peter Wilks' brother Harvey, and this is his\r\n",
      "brother William, which can't hear nor speak--and can't even make signs to\r\n",
      "amount to much, now't he's only got one hand to work them with.  We are\r\n",
      "who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can\r\n",
      "prove it. But up till then I won't say nothing more, but go to the hotel\r\n",
      "and wait.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Broke his arm--_very_ likely, _ain't_ it?--and very convenient, too,\r\n",

      "_circumstances_!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four,\r\n",
      "or maybe half a dozen.  One of these was that doctor; another one was\r\n",
      "a sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind\r\n",
      "made out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and\r\n",
      "was talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and\r\n",
      "then and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone\r\n",
      "up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along\r\n",
      "and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the\r\n",
      "king now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:\r\n",

      "he was up there.  I see him there.  He come in a canoe, along with Tim\r\n",
      "Collins and a boy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "“Neighbors, I don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if\r\n",
      "_these_ two ain't frauds, I am an idiot, that's all.  I think it's our\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's friends; so\r\n",
      "we all started.  It was about sundown.  The doctor he led me along by\r\n",
      "the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and\r\n",
      "fetched in the new couple.  First, the doctor says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they're\r\n",
      "frauds, and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about.\r\n",
      " If they have, won't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter\r\n",
      "Wilks left?  It ain't unlikely.  If these men ain't frauds, they won't\r\n",
      "object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove\r\n",
      "they're all right--ain't that so?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everybody agreed to that.  So I judged they had our gang in a pretty\r\n",
      "tight place right at the outstart.  But the king he only looked\r\n",
      "sorrowful, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no disposition\r\n",
      "to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation\r\n",
      "o' this misable business; but, alas, the money ain't there; you k'n send\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Where is it, then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it\r\n",

      "days we'd be here, and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein'\r\n",
      "used to niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like servants in England.\r\n",
      " The niggers stole it the very next mornin' after I had went down\r\n",
      "stairs; and when I sold 'em I hadn't missed the money yit, so they got\r\n",
      "clean away with it.  My servant here k'n tell you 'bout it, gentlemen.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The doctor and several said “Shucks!” and I see nobody didn't altogether\r\n",
      "believe him.  One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it.  I said\r\n",
      "no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I\r\n",
      "never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up\r\n",
      "my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.\r\n",
      " That was all they asked me.  Then the doctor whirls on me and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are _you_ English, too?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, “Stuff!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had\r\n",
      "it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about\r\n",
      "supper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and\r\n",
      "kept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.  They\r\n",
      "made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n;\r\n",
      "and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_ that the\r\n",
      "old gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies.  And by and by\r\n",
      "they had me up to tell what I knowed.  The king he give me a left-handed\r\n",
      "look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the\r\n",
      "right side.  I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,\r\n",
      "and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty\r\n",
      "fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you.  I reckon\r\n",
      "you ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is\r\n",
      "practice.  You do it pretty awkward.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,\r\n",
      "anyway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell--” The king broke in and\r\n",
      "reached out his hand, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often\r\n",
      "about?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked\r\n",
      "pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side\r\n",
      "and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That 'll fix it.  I'll take the order and send it, along with your\r\n",
      "brother's, and then they'll know it's all right.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted\r\n",
      "his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;\r\n",
      "and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the\r\n",
      "duke looked sick.  But he took the pen and wrote.  So then the lawyer\r\n",
      "turns to the new old gentleman and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it.  The lawyer looked\r\n",
      "powerful astonished, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, it beats _me_”--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,\r\n",
      "and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then\r\n",
      "_them_ again; and then says:  “These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;\r\n",
      "and here's _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't\r\n",
      "write them” (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell\r\n",
      "you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), “and here's _this_ old\r\n",
      "gentleman's hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn't\r\n",
      "write them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain't properly _writing_ at\r\n",
      "all.  Now, here's some letters from--”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The new old gentleman says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you please, let me explain.  Nobody can read my hand but my brother\r\n",
      "there--so he copies for me.  It's _his_ hand you've got there, not mine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Well_!” says the lawyer, “this _is_ a state of things.  I've got some\r\n",
      "of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we\r\n",
      "can com--”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He _can't_ write with his left hand,” says the old gentleman.  “If he\r\n",
      "could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters\r\n",
      "and mine too.  Look at both, please--they're by the same hand.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lawyer done it, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I believe it's so--and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger\r\n",
      "resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway.  Well, well, well!  I\r\n",
      "thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass,\r\n",
      "partly.  But anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ain't either of 'em\r\n",
      "Wilkses”--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, what do you think?  That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in\r\n",
      "_then_! Indeed he wouldn't.  Said it warn't no fair test.  Said his\r\n",
      "brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried\r\n",
      "to write--_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute\r\n",
      "he put the pen to paper.  And so he warmed up and went warbling and\r\n",
      "warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was\r\n",
      "saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I've thought of something.  Is there anybody here that helped to lay\r\n",
      "out my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it.  We're both here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a\r\n",
      "squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took\r\n",
      "him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make\r\n",
      "most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any\r\n",
      "notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?\r\n",
      " He whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in\r\n",
      "there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him.  Says\r\n",
      "I to myself, _now_ he'll throw up the sponge--there ain't no more use.\r\n",
      " Well, did he?  A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't.  I reckon\r\n",
      "he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so\r\n",
      "they'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.\r\n",
      " Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mf!  It's a _very_ tough question, _ain't_ it!  _yes_, sir, I k'n\r\n",
      "tell you what's tattooed on his breast.  It's jest a small, thin, blue\r\n",
      "arrow--that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it.\r\n",
      " _now_ what do you say--hey?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out\r\n",
      "cheek.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and\r\n",
      "his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king _this_ time, and\r\n",
      "says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There--you've heard what he said!  Was there any such mark on Peter\r\n",
      "Wilks' breast?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both of them spoke up and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We didn't see no such mark.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good!” says the old gentleman.  “Now, what you _did_ see on his breast\r\n",
      "was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was\r\n",
      "young), and a W, with dashes between them, so:  P--B--W”--and he marked\r\n",
      "them that way on a piece of paper.  “Come, ain't that what you saw?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both of them spoke up again, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, we _didn't_.  We never seen any marks at all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The whole _bilin_' of 'm 's frauds!  Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em!\r\n",
      "le's ride 'em on a rail!” and everybody was whooping at once, and there\r\n",
      "was a rattling powwow.  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,\r\n",
      "and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Gentlemen--gentle_men!_  Hear me just a word--just a _single_ word--if you\r\n",
      "_please_!  There's one way yet--let's go and dig up the corpse and look.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That took them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hooray!” they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer\r\n",
      "and the doctor sung out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hold on, hold on!  Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch\r\n",
      "_them_ along, too!”\r\n",

      "graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole\r\n",

      "was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from\r\n",
      "what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time\r\n",
      "if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to\r\n",
      "save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the\r\n",

      "time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the\r\n",
      "wrist--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.  He\r\n",
      "dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it\r\n",
      "like an overflow.  And when they got to the grave they found they had\r\n",
      "about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't\r\n",
      "thought to fetch a lantern.  But they sailed into digging anyway by the\r\n",

      "no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute\r\n",
      "you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the\r\n",
      "shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the\r\n",
      "dark wiped it all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then\r\n",
      "such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to\r\n",
      "scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it\r\n",
      "was awful.  Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,\r\n",
      "and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and\r\n",
      "panting.\r\n",

      "buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of\r\n",

      "When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so\r\n",

      "set it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and\r\n",
      "disappointed, I didn't know why.  But at last, just as I was sailing by,\r\n",
      "_flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up\r\n",
      "sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind\r\n",

      "up the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I'd got out of the Nonesuch\r\n",
      "and one thing or another, and scoop it _all_!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:\r\n",

      "down the river.  We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty\r\n",
      "long ways from home.  We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on\r\n",

      "first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough\r\n",

      "a little of everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck.  So at\r\n",
      "last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she\r\n",
      "floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the\r\n",
      "half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an\r\n",

      "for leaving her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again;\r\n",
      "and if she didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,\r\n",

      "more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when\r\n",
      "it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence\r\n",
      "slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It made me shiver.  And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I\r\n",
      "couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better.  So\r\n",
      "I kneeled down.  But the words wouldn't come.  Why wouldn't they?  It\r\n",
      "warn't no use to try and hide it from Him.  Nor from _me_, neither.  I\r\n",
      "knowed very well why they wouldn't come.  It was because my heart warn't\r\n",
      "right; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was playing\r\n",
      "double.  I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was\r\n",
      "holding on to the biggest one of all.  I was trying to make my mouth\r\n",
      "_say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write\r\n",
      "to that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I\r\n",
      "knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it.  You can't pray a lie--I found\r\n",
      "that out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to\r\n",
      "do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter--and\r\n",
      "then see if I can pray.  Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as\r\n",
      "light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.  So I\r\n",
      "got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down\r\n",
      "and wrote:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below\r\n",
      "Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the\r\n",
      "reward if you send.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "_Huck Finn._\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever\r\n",
      "felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.  But I didn't do it\r\n",
      "straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking\r\n",
      "how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost\r\n",
      "and going to hell.  And went on thinking.  And got to thinking over our\r\n",
      "trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the day\r\n",
      "and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we\r\n",
      "a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow I\r\n",
      "couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the\r\n",
      "other kind.  I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of\r\n",
      "calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when\r\n",
      "I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp,\r\n",
      "up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call\r\n",
      "me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how\r\n",
      "good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling\r\n",
      "the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was\r\n",
      "the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he's\r\n",
      "got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I was\r\n",
      "a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and\r\n",
      "I knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then\r\n",
      "says to myself:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right, then, I'll _go_ to hell”--and tore it up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And I let\r\n",
      "them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.  I shoved the\r\n",
      "whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,\r\n",
      "which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't.  And\r\n",
      "for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;\r\n",
      "and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as\r\n",
      "long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some\r\n",
      "considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that\r\n",
      "suited me.  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down\r\n",
      "the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my\r\n",
      "raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.  I slept the\r\n",
      "night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,\r\n",
      "and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or\r\n",
      "another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landed\r\n",
      "below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,\r\n",
      "and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and\r\n",
      "sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter\r\n",
      "of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on\r\n",
      "it, “Phelps's Sawmill,” and when I come to the farm-houses, two or\r\n",
      "three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't\r\n",
      "see nobody around, though it was good daylight now.  But I didn't mind,\r\n",
      "because I didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the\r\n",
      "lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from\r\n",
      "the village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved along,\r\n",
      "straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was\r\n",
      "the duke.  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night\r\n",
      "performance--like that other time.  They had the cheek, them frauds!  I\r\n",
      "was right on him before I could shirk.  He looked astonished, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hel-_lo_!  Where'd _you_ come from?”  Then he says, kind of glad and\r\n",
      "eager, “Where's the raft?--got her in a good place?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What was your idea for asking _me_?” he says.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says\r\n",
      "to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went\r\n",
      "a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.  A man up and offered\r\n",
      "me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch\r\n",
      "a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,\r\n",
      "and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him\r\n",
      "along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after\r\n",
      "him.  We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the\r\n",
      "country till we tired him out.  We never got him till dark; then we\r\n",
      "fetched him over, and I started down for the raft.  When I got there and\r\n",
      "see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had to\r\n",
      "leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in\r\n",
      "the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property\r\n",
      "no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and\r\n",
      "cried.  I slept in the woods all night.  But what _did_ become of the\r\n",
      "raft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Blamed if I know--that is, what's become of the raft.  That old fool had\r\n",
      "made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery\r\n",
      "the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but\r\n",
      "what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and\r\n",
      "found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and\r\n",
      "shook us, and run off down the river.'”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wouldn't shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the\r\n",
      "world, and the only property.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We never thought of that.  Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him\r\n",
      "_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble\r\n",
      "enough for him.  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,\r\n",
      "there warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another\r\n",
      "shake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.  Where's\r\n",
      "that ten cents? Give it here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to\r\n",
      "spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the\r\n",
      "money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday.  He never\r\n",
      "said nothing.  The next minute he whirls on me and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?  We'd skin him if he done\r\n",
      "that!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How can he blow?  Hain't he run off?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No!  That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money's\r\n",
      "gone.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Sold_ him?”  I says, and begun to cry; “why, he was _my_ nigger, and\r\n",
      "that was my money.  Where is he?--I want my nigger.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you can't _get_ your nigger, that's all--so dry up your\r\n",
      "blubbering. Looky here--do you think _you'd_ venture to blow on us?\r\n",
      " Blamed if I think I'd trust you.  Why, if you _was_ to blow on us--”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes\r\n",
      "before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.\r\n",
      "I got to turn out and find my nigger.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on\r\n",
      "his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.  At last he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I'll tell you something.  We got to be here three days.  If you'll\r\n",
      "promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you\r\n",
      "where to find him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So I promised, and he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--” and then he stopped.  You see, he\r\n",
      "started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to\r\n",
      "study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.  And so he\r\n",
      "was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of\r\n",
      "the way the whole three days.  So pretty soon he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he\r\n",
      "lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days.  And I'll start this\r\n",
      "very afternoon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No you wont, you'll start _now_; and don't you lose any time about it,\r\n",
      "neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  Just keep a tight tongue in\r\n",
      "your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with\r\n",
      "_us_, d'ye hear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.  I\r\n",
      "wanted to be left free to work my plans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want\r\n",
      "to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger--some\r\n",
      "idiots don't require documents--leastways I've heard there's such down\r\n",
      "South here.  And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus,\r\n",
      "maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for\r\n",
      "getting 'em out.  Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but\r\n",
      "mind you don't work your jaw any _between_ here and there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So I left, and struck for the back country.  I didn't look around, but I\r\n",
      "kinder felt like he was watching me.  But I knowed I could tire him out\r\n",
      "at that.  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before\r\n",
      "I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'.  I\r\n",
      "reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling\r\n",
      "around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could\r\n",
      "get away.  I didn't want no trouble with their kind.  I'd seen all I\r\n",

      "in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of\r\n",
      "old cold cannibal in the morning.  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long\r\n",
      "blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit,\r\n",
      "neither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.\r\n",

      "boys says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” says the old man, “I reckon there ain't going to be any; and you\r\n",
      "couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and\r\n",
      "me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to\r\n",
      "bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the\r\n",
      "lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn't believe anybody was\r\n",
      "going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn't hurry up\r\n",
      "and give them one they'd get into trouble sure.\r\n",

      "On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,\r\n",
      "and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back no more, and\r\n",
      "what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our\r\n",
      "Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had\r\n",
      "time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of\r\n",
      "it--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of\r\n",
      "people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin\r\n",
      "pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;\r\n",
      "and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a\r\n",
      "rail--that is, I knowed it _was_ the king and the duke, though they was\r\n",
      "all over tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the\r\n",
      "world that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big\r\n",
      "soldier-plumes.  Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for\r\n",
      "them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn't ever feel any\r\n",
      "hardness against them any more in the world.  It was a dreadful thing to\r\n",
      "see.  Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We see we was too late--couldn't do no good.  We asked some stragglers\r\n",
      "about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very\r\n",
      "innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the\r\n",
      "middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and\r\n",
      "the house rose up and went for them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was\r\n",
      "before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though\r\n",
      "I hadn't done nothing.  But that's always the way; it don't make no\r\n",
      "difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't\r\n",
      "got no sense, and just goes for him anyway.  If I had a yaller dog that\r\n",
      "didn't know no more than a person's conscience does I would pison him.\r\n",
      "It takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet\r\n",

      "so as to see what the hounds would do.  They knowed us, and didn't make\r\n",
      "no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by\r\n",
      "in the night.  When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and\r\n",
      "the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with--which was the\r\n",
      "north side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just\r\n",
      "one stout board nailed across it.  I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here's the ticket.  This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if we\r\n",
      "wrench off the board.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as\r\n",
      "playing hooky.  I should _hope_ we can find a way that's a little more\r\n",
      "complicated than _that_, Huck Finn.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, then,” I says, “how 'll it do to saw him out, the way I done\r\n",
      "before I was murdered that time?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That's more _like_,” he says.  “It's real mysterious, and troublesome,\r\n",
      "and good,” he says; “but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.\r\n",
      " There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that\r\n",
      "joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.  It was as long\r\n",
      "as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide.  The door to it was at\r\n",
      "the south end, and was padlocked.  Tom he went to the soap-kettle and\r\n",
      "searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;\r\n",
      "so he took it and prized out one of the staples.  The chain fell down,\r\n",
      "and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,\r\n",
      "and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection\r\n",
      "with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but\r\n",
      "some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.\r\n",
      " The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and\r\n",
      "the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.  He says;\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now we're all right.  We'll _dig_ him out.  It 'll take about a week!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have\r\n",
      "to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but that\r\n",
      "warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must\r\n",
      "climb up the lightning-rod.  But after he got up half way about three\r\n",
      "times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most\r\n",
      "busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he\r\n",
      "was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this\r\n",
      "time he made the trip.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins\r\n",
      "to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it\r\n",
      "_was_ Jim that was being fed.  The niggers was just getting through\r\n",
      "breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up\r\n",
      "a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was\r\n",
      "leaving, the key come from the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was\r\n",
      "all tied up in little bunches with thread.  That was to keep witches\r\n",
      "off.  He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and\r\n",
      "making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of\r\n",
      "strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so\r\n",
      "long before in his life.  He got so worked up, and got to running on so\r\n",
      "about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do.\r\n",
      " So Tom says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What's the vittles for?  Going to feed the dogs?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you\r\n",
      "heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Mars Sid, A dog.  Cur'us dog, too.  Does you want to go en look at\r\n",
      "'im?”\r\n",

      "we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure\r\n",
      "enough, and could see us; and he sings out:\r\n",

      "“Why, _Huck_!  En good _lan_'! ain' dat Misto Tom?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it.  I didn't know\r\n",
      "nothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because that nigger\r\n",
      "busted in and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We could see pretty well now.  Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and\r\n",
      "kind of wondering, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Does _who_ know us?”\r\n",

      " _what_ did he sing out?” And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says,\r\n",
      "“Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,\r\n",

      "IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down\r\n",

      "AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the\r\n",
      "lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our\r\n",
      "pile of fox-fire, and went to work.  We cleared everything out of the\r\n",
      "way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.  Tom\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work.  If we was prisoners\r\n",
      "it would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and no\r\n",
      "hurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while\r\n",

      "we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,\r\n",

      "rush; we ain't got no time to spare.  If we was to put in another\r\n",

      "it to get out; but there ain't only just the one way:  we got to dig him\r\n",
      "out with the picks, and _let on_ it's case-knives.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Now_ you're _talking_!”  I says; “your head gets leveler and leveler\r\n",
      "all the time, Tom Sawyer,” I says.  “Picks is the thing, moral or no\r\n",
      "moral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.\r\n",
      " When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school\r\n",
      "book, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done.  What I\r\n",
      "want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my\r\n",
      "Sunday-school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thing\r\n",

      "this; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't stand by\r\n",
      "and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,\r\n",
      "and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and\r\n",
      "knows better.  It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,\r\n",
      "_without_ any letting on, because you don't know no better; but it\r\n",
      "wouldn't for me, because I do know better.  Gimme a case-knife.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had his own by him, but I handed him mine.  He flung it down, and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Gimme a _case-knife_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I didn't know just what to do--but then I thought.  I scratched around\r\n",
      "amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took\r\n",
      "it and went to work, and never said a word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was always just that particular.  Full of principle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,\r\n",
      "and made the fur fly.  We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as\r\n",
      "long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for\r\n",
      "it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing\r\n",
      "his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his\r\n",
      "hands was so sore.  At last he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It ain't no use, it can't be done.  What you reckon I better do?  Can't\r\n",
      "you think of no way?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” I says, “but I reckon it ain't regular.  Come up the stairs, and\r\n",
      "let on it's a lightning-rod.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So he done it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,\r\n",
      "for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I\r\n",
      "hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin\r\n",
      "plates.  Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever see\r\n",
      "the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel\r\n",
      "and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and\r\n",
      "he could use them over again.  So Tom was satisfied.  Then he says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it done.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard\r\n",
      "of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.  By and by he\r\n",
      "said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to\r\n",
      "decide on any of them yet.  Said we'd got to post Jim first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took\r\n",
      "one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard\r\n",
      "Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him.  Then we\r\n",
      "whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half\r\n",
      "the job was done.  We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and\r\n",
      "pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,\r\n",
      "and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle\r\n",
      "and gradual.  He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us\r\n",
      "honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us\r\n",
      "hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,\r\n",
      "and clearing out without losing any time.  But Tom he showed him how\r\n",
      "unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,\r\n",
      "and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and\r\n",
      "not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.\r\n",
      " So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old\r\n",
      "times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told\r\n",
      "him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt\r\n",
      "Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and\r\n",
      "both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Now_ I know how to fix it.  We'll send you some things by them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I said, “Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass\r\n",
      "ideas I ever struck;” but he never paid no attention to me; went right\r\n",
      "on.  It was his way when he'd got his plans set.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other\r\n",
      "large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the\r\n",
      "lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and\r\n",
      "we would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them\r\n",
      "out; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her\r\n",
      "apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and\r\n",
      "what they was for.  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with\r\n",
      "his blood, and all that. He told him everything.  Jim he couldn't see\r\n",
      "no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed\r\n",
      "better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just\r\n",
      "as Tom said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good\r\n",
      "sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to\r\n",
      "bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed.  Tom was in high\r\n",
      "spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the\r\n",
      "most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would\r\n",
      "keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to\r\n",
      "get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the\r\n",
      "more he got used to it.  He said that in that way it could be strung out\r\n",
      "to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.  And he\r\n",
      "said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass\r\n",
      "candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in\r\n",
      "his pocket.  Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's\r\n",
      "notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a\r\n",
      "corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how\r\n",
      "it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most\r\n",
      "mashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked\r\n",
      "better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only\r\n",
      "just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into\r\n",
      "bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he\r\n",
      "jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a\r\n",
      "couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept on\r\n",
      "piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room\r\n",
      "in there to get your breath.  By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to\r\n",
      "door!  The nigger Nat he only just hollered “Witches” once, and keeled\r\n",
      "over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was\r\n",
      "dying.  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat,\r\n",
      "and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back\r\n",
      "again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.\r\n",
      "Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and\r\n",
      "asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again.  He raised up,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybody\r\n",
      "would.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I declare to gracious ther' _ain't_ but nine!” she says.  “Why, what in\r\n",
      "the world--plague _take_ the things, I'll count 'm again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she\r\n",

      "“You numskull, didn't you see me _count 'm?_”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I'll count 'm _again_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.\r\n",
      " Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so\r\n",
      "mad.  But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start\r\n",
      "to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they\r\n",
      "come out right, and three times they come out wrong.  Then she grabbed\r\n",
      "up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat\r\n",
      "galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if\r\n",
      "we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin\r\n",
      "us.  So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst\r\n",
      "she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along\r\n",
      "with her shingle nail, before noon.  We was very well satisfied with\r\n",
      "this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,\r\n",
      "because he said _now_ she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike\r\n",
      "again to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if\r\n",
      "she _did_; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the\r\n",
      "next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody\r\n",
      "that wanted her to ever count them any more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of\r\n",
      "her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a\r\n",
      "couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more,\r\n",
      "and she didn't _care_, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her\r\n",
      "soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life;\r\n",
      "she druther die first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon\r\n",
      "and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up\r\n",
      "counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would\r\n",
      "blow over by and by.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.  We\r\n",
      "fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it\r\n",
      "done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we\r\n",
      "had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and\r\n",
      "we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with\r\n",
      "the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we\r\n",
      "couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in.  But of course\r\n",
      "we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too,\r\n",
      "in the pie.  So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore\r\n",
      "up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long\r\n",
      "before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person\r\n",
      "with.  We let on it took nine months to make it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go\r\n",
      "into the pie.  Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope\r\n",
      "enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over\r\n",
      "for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose.  We could a had a whole\r\n",
      "dinner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But we didn't need it.  All we needed was just enough for the pie, and\r\n",
      "so we throwed the rest away.  We didn't cook none of the pies in the\r\n",
      "wash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble\r\n",
      "brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged\r\n",

      "warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked\r\n",
      "her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first\r\n",
      "pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last\r\n",
      "one.  We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and\r\n",
      "loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the\r\n",
      "lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long\r\n",
      "handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a\r\n",

      "never see such a woman.  And you could hear her whoop to Jericho.  You\r\n",
      "couldn't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs.  And if\r\n",
      "she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a\r\n",
      "howl that you would think the house was afire.  She disturbed the old\r\n",
      "man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes\r\n",
      "created.  Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the\r\n",
      "house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't\r\n",
      "near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could\r\n",
      "touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump\r\n",
      "right out of her stockings.  It was very curious.  But Tom said all\r\n",
      "women was just so.  He said they was made that way for some reason or\r\n",
      "other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she\r\n",
      "allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever\r\n",
      "loaded up the place again with them.  I didn't mind the lickings,\r\n",
      "because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we\r\n",
      "had to lay in another lot.  But we got them laid in, and all the other\r\n",
      "things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd\r\n",
      "all swarm out for music and go for him.  Jim didn't like the spiders,\r\n",
      "and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it\r\n",
      "mighty warm for him.  And he said that between the rats and the snakes\r\n",
      "and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and\r\n",
      "when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was\r\n",
      "always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but\r\n",
      "took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and\r\n",
      "when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one\r\n",
      "gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him,\r\n",
      "and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at\r\n",
      "him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't\r\n",
      "ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.\r\n",
      " The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he\r\n",
      "would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh;\r\n",
      "the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the\r\n",
      "grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,\r\n",
      "and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.  We reckoned we was all\r\n",
      "going to die, but didn't.  It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever\r\n",
      "see; and Tom said the same.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we was\r\n",
      "all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim.  The old man had wrote\r\n",
      "a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their\r\n",
      "runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no such\r\n",
      "plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and\r\n",
      "New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me\r\n",
      "the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now\r\n",
      "for the nonnamous letters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.  It's a very good\r\n",
      "way, and so is the nonnamous letters.  We'll use them both.  And it's\r\n",
      "usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and she\r\n",
      "stays in, and he slides out in her clothes.  We'll do that, too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that\r\n",

      "don't _give_ them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere\r\n",
      "with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go\r\n",

      "“Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shucks!” he says, and looked disgusted.  So I says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards,\r\n",
      "along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the\r\n",
      "nigger's cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn\r\n",
      "if I see any danger; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as\r\n",

      "you get there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as\r\n",
      "a person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of\r\n",
      "corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs\r\n",
      "very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes\r\n",
      "Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped\r\n",

      "about every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she says,\r\n",

      "My, but there was a crowd there!  Fifteen farmers, and every one of them\r\n",
      "had a gun.  I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.\r\n",
      "They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice,\r\n",

      "and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their\r\n",
      "seats, and fumbling with their buttons.  I warn't easy myself, but I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if\r\n",

      "was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and\r\n",
      "lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn't but a few minutes to\r\n",
      "midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the\r\n",

      "me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was\r\n",
      "that scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter\r\n",
      "beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty\r\n",
      "soon, when one of them says, “I'M for going and getting in the cabin\r\n",

      "you till morning!”\r\n",

      "with guns!\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them\r\n",
      "begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I _told_ you we'd be too soon; they haven't come--the door is locked.\r\n",
      "Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on\r\n",
      "us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.  But we got under all\r\n",
      "right, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,\r\n",
      "and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders.  Now we was in the\r\n",
      "lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside.  So we crept to the door,\r\n",
      "and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't make\r\n",
      "out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen\r\n",
      "for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out\r\n",
      "first, and him last.  So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and\r\n",
      "listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all\r\n",
      "the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down,\r\n",
      "not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy\r\n",
      "towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim\r\n",
      "over it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top\r\n",
      "rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which\r\n",
      "snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks\r\n",

      "all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait\r\n",
      "till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better\r\n",
      "go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.  But\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a\r\n",
      "whole family scared most to death for days and nights.  But the others\r\n",
      "said, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and\r\n",
      "his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure.  So that cooled\r\n",

      "about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with\r\n",

      "the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says\r\n",
      "he'll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well.  Of course I\r\n",

      "to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.  It\r\n",
      "was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and\r\n",
      "of course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't,\r\n",
      "because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet\r\n",
      "never a skiff come close enough for me to hail.  So there I had to stick\r\n",

      "_was_, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till about\r\n",
      "dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck\r\n",
      "would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped\r\n",
      "on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped\r\n",
      "up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was\r\n",
      "about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a\r\n",
      "flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and\r\n",
      "towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful\r\n",
      "to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was\r\n",
      "according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good\r\n",
      "heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him.  Then they\r\n",
      "all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some\r\n",
      "notice took of it, and reward.  So every one of them promised, right out\r\n",
      "and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then they come out and locked him up.  I hoped they was going to say he\r\n",
      "could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten\r\n",
      "heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they\r\n",
      "didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but\r\n",

      "around hunting the runaway nigger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I had plenty time.  Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt\r\n",
      "Sally was gone to get a nap.  So I slips to the sick-room, and if I\r\n",
      "found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that\r\n",
      "would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and\r\n",
      "pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come.  So I set down and\r\n",
      "laid for him to wake.  In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding\r\n",
      "in, and there I was, up a stump again!  She motioned me to be still, and\r\n",
      "set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful\r\n",
      "now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping\r\n",
      "like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the\r\n",
      "time, and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his\r\n",
      "eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hello!--why, I'm at _home_!  How's that?  Where's the raft?”\r\n",

      "“Good!  Splendid!  _Now_ we're all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  “About what, Sid?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, about the way the whole thing was done.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What whole thing?”\r\n",

      "him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and\r\n",
      "I see it warn't no use for _me_ to put in.  “Why, Aunty, it cost us a\r\n",
      "power of work--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you was\r\n",
      "all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt,\r\n",

      "warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things,\r\n",

      "inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can't think _half_ the\r\n",
      "fun it was.  And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things,\r\n",
      "and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the\r\n",
      "lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder\r\n",

      "with in your apron pocket--”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before\r\n",
      "we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let\r\n",
      "drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let\r\n",
      "them go by, and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us, but\r\n",
      "went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the\r\n",
