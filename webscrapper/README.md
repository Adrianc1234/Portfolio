## What is LinkedIn?

LinkedIn is a platform that was born as a social network for professionals and companies. Its main objective is to connect people looking for work synergies and new professional or business opportunities.

It is currently owned by Microsoft and is considered the largest professional community worldwide. In fact, in Spain alone it already has more than 10 million users, since it was launched in 2003.

It is a network designed not so much to foster personal relationships, as Instagram, Facebook or Twitter are, but to create a network of contacts in the professional or work environment.
